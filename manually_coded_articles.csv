"Locals want clean Ganga, smooth roads in 2011",The Times of India (TOI),01-01-2011,KANPUR,"KANPUR: After having bumpy rides on the dug-up roads of the city in 2010, the commuters are praying for smoother roads to ride on in the new year.
The ongoing work of laying of sewerlines under the JNNURM programme left the city folks gasping for breath as the digging of roads resulted in dust particles flowing all around in the air.
It is now expected that in next six months, the work will be complete and only then will come relief for the city people.
The long hours of power cuts forced people to depend on generators. The generators in turn not only created air pollution but also added sound pollution.
The pollution in the Ganga river also remained a hot issue throughout the year.
It was only after the Allahabad High Court issued special directives to the pollution board asking it to crack down on erring tanneries, that a few leather units were closed down and heavy penalties were imposed on some other units.
Locals hope that year 2011 would see the pollution level going down in the holy river.
It was in this direction only that professor Vinod Tare from IIT-Kanpur had demonstrated a 'zero toilet discharge system (ZTDS)' developed by him in his lab.
The ZTDS, as the name suggests, is a look alike of most of the conventional toilets with an only difference being that the water consumption in this system is based on ecological sanitation.
The ZTDS consists of a separator device below the toilet that divides solids and liquids but the rest of the outside appearance of the ZTDS is completely similar to that of a conventional toilet.
The solid waste passes through a different stream and liquid from a different stream. One part of the solid waste is mixed with two parts of cow dung and recycled for atleast 20 times before it is left to decay and form a quality compost. The liquid part is recycled and utilised as flush water. The water is collected, filtered, treated and then recycled to be used for flushing.
Microbial agents are used for eliminating odour. This recycling technique removes the need for fresh water in flushing. This system can be installed as public toilets and hence the waste released from these toilets into the Ganga can be avoided. In 2011, not only the city but the entire nation would like to see the holy Ganga flowing clean.

"Gadgil visits pollution hit Khandola, Betki areas",The Times of India (TOI),9/27/2011,GOA,"Keri: Madhav Gadgil, chairman of Western Ghats expert panel, on Monday evening visited Khandola and Betki villages of Ponda taluka on a request from the Betki-Khandola Pradushan Virodhi Kruti Samiti .
Locals from Khandola, Betki, Amona and other villages had requested Gadgil to visit their villages. It is alleged that the villages are affected by air and water pollution from Sesa Goa's pig iron plant at Amona.
At an interactive session, Gadgil applauded efforts of villagers to protect the area from pollution.
Madhu Gaonkar, secretary of the Samiti, alleged, ""Our agriculture dominated villages have become affected by air and water pollution. The yield of coconuts, paddy and other crops has decreased drastically. Villagers have given up agricultural and horticultural activities.""
Panch member and president of BKPVKS Dinesh Sada Gawde said, ""Presently this company is involved in the expansion of their plant in Amona and this will intensify pollution.""
Khemlo Sawant from Betalwada-Amona gave copies of a report of the zonal agricultural officer of Bicholim and of Goa state pollution control board of damage caused to agricultural crops and cashew plantations in the area.

'Frequent hikes may blunt CNG green edge',The Times of India (TOI),10/19/2011,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Frequent hikes in prices of CNG (compressed natural gas) has got the EPCA (Environment Protection Control Agency) to ask IGL (Indraprastha Gas Limited), the sole supplier of the fuel in the city, to desist from making any further price change.
<br/><br/>
Officials said regulating the price of CNG was essential to ensure that it did not lose out to diesel. At present, diesel vehicles account for more than 50% of all personal car sales in the city, posing an air pollution nightmare for the government.
<br/><br/>
""Often people prefer diesel over CNG as the former is a tried and tested technology and is known to show better engine performance. The only advantage that CNG enjoys is its price; but the rate at which it is being hiked, it will soon cost as much as diesel and lose even that advantage,"" said EPCA chairman
Bhurelal.
<br/><br/>
CNG became available in the city around 2001 and was priced around Rs 13 per kilo. At present, it costs Rs 32 per kilo, while diesel costs Rs 41.29 per litre. ""Internationally, CNG prices are about 25% less than that of diesel. In Delhi, this difference does not exist. IGL officials gave us several reasons for the recent hikes but we believe that inefficiency costs should not be passed onto consumers. IGL is also expanding its infrastructure and that will only get them more business in the city. There is no need for them to pass on their capital costs to consumers either,"" added Bhurelal.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
IGL, which had last hiked CNG price by Rs 2 on October 1, justified it by saying that it's still operating under several constraints.
<br/><br/>
Rajesh Vedvyas, managing director, IGL, said that the hike was a result of a recent steep appreciation of dollar against the rupee and an increased power tariff.

"Noise levels up, air pollution dips",The Times of India (TOI),10/28/2011,BANGALORE,"BANGALORE: Thanks to 19.4 mm rain on Tuesday, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) recorded a 15%-28% dip in air pollution compared to normal days in Bangalore on the first day of Diwali on Tuesday.
The board said the rain helped in settling down the suspended air particles and in bringing down the air pollution level. Monitoring of air quality was done at two locations, City Railway Station and SG Halli Regional Office complex. The department had taken readings on October 22 (normal day) and tallied them with Tuesday's figures to arrive at the increase or decrease during Diwali.
While the ambient air quality remained pretty encouraging on Tuesday, noise pollution figures in the city were quite high. KSPCB included some areas in the city for the first time to monitor noise pollution levels. Kumara Park West recorded a 36% rise in the decibel level from any normal day. On a normal day, it records a decibel level somewhere around the 56 mark whereas on Tuesday the noise climbed up to a high 75 units.
At Fortis Hospital, Nagarabhavi, the noise pollution figures went up by 38% (from 59.3 to 75.8 decibels). Indiranagar ESI Hospital, Vijayanagar Club, AECS Layout in Whitefield and Cubbon Pet have recorded an increase of 24%, 16%, 32% and 3% respectively, while the remaining areas monitored have recorded decibel figures well within the permissible limit.
""We monitored the noise pollution levels at 12 different areas in Bangalore alone. Though we installed the noise level meter at 14 different places across the city, we based our readings on data collected from 12 of these meters,"" said A S Sadashivaiah, KSPCB chairman. The department also collected figures from an online monitoring of noise pollution levels at five different places in Bangalore.
Officials said the air pollution figures are likely to shoot up in the next two days of Diwali, on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. Final figures would be compiled on the basis of monitoring air pollution from 6 pm to 12 am on all three days.

Winter's woes: Prepare for the clouds of dust,The Times of India (TOI),11-07-2011,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: Every winter, Kolkata is blanketed in smog and haze and this year would be no exception. With the mercury dipping with a nip in the air from night till dawn, dust particles are increasing suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the atmosphere. Density of dust particles is higher at construction sites work is rampant, thus increasing the level of dust pollution.
According to air measurements taken by West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), the level of fine particles (PM 10) in the air is hovering around 150 (g/m3) for the last few days against the residential standard of 100 (g/m3) per day. The city's PM 10 level for the three days from October 29 to October 31 was 146.58 (g/m3), 157.33(g/m3) and 153.25(g/m3) respectively.
Busy crossings like Shyambazar and Gariahat are particularly witnessing this high PM 10 level. From 6am on October 30 to 6am on October 31till the same time on Monday, Gariahat's PM 10 level stood at 161.33 (g/m3) and that of Shyambazar at 195.67(g/m3). The concentration of these fine particles is much higher at construction sites.
In the last three days from last Wednesday to Friday, the PM 10 level in the city was as high as 176.20(g/m3), 172.89 (g/m3) and 181.53 (g/m3) respectively, which is almost double the residential standard.
Karunamoyee Island in Salt Lake, where work on the east-west metro project is in full swing, is reeling under problems of dust pollution. A local staying near Karunamoyee said, ""Dust pollution has increased manifold at this spot since work on the east- west metro project began, leading to respiratory problems, particularly among the elderly residents.""
The situation is no different at other places in the city where construction work is in progress. A flyover project is underway at the stretch between Panama Island and Park Circus at the Park Circus connector, leading to an increase in the density of dust particles. With numerous construction projects going on at Rajarhat, Sector V and places off EM Bypass, dust pollution level at these places is on the rise as well.
areas like Karunamoyee Island in Salt Lake where work on the east-west metro project is in full swing, the Park Circus connector stretch from Parama Island to Park Circus where a flyover project is on, Rajarhat and places off EM Bypass and Sector V where rapid construction work is on also have high dust pollution. A local residing near Karunamoyee Island said, ""Dust pollution has increased manifold in this spot since work on the east west metro project began, leading to respiratory problems, particularly amongst the elderly residents living here,""
A WBPCB survey conducted some years ago found the SPM level in these areas adjoining the city almost five times higher than the permissible limit. Dust particles also increase in the city proper due to haphazard digging of roads to lay and re-lay water and sewer pipelines, telephone and electric cables.
Dust pollution
The pollution is common particularly in winter because humidity declines and the soil surface dries, resulting in increased SPM. Dust particles form a visible layer in the air, particularly in the evenings.
WBPCB chairman Binoy Kanti Dutta said that dust pollution exists round the year but it increases in winter.
The increase in fine dust particles in the air causes several respiratory diseases like dust allergy, dry cough, asthma and other chronic pulmonary ailments.
Construction engineers conceded that the maximum concentration of dust particles is at construction sites because mainly is at places where massive construction work is on as
dust particles do not spread much. ""There are a few advanced techniques to minimize dust pollution at construction sites, like spraying water and artificially increasing the humidity level in a very small area through a method called artificial conditioning of micro climate. As humidity level is raised, dust particles diminish. Also, the technique of increasing negative ion and putting up curtains around a construction site can also prevent dust pollution,"" said reputed structural engineer Anjan Kumar Dutta.
Construction companies, however, need to purchase these high-end equipment which are a little expensive. will only have to buy these sophisticated equipments which are a little costly.

Brick Kilns Flout rules with impunity,The Times of India (TOI),12/28/2011,JAIPUR,"Neemrana: Looking down from the Neemrana Fort, a blanket of smog and smoke envelops the Neemrana industrial area, the hub of Japanese investment in India. But for early hours in the morning, there is very little visibility and by sun down, the smoke layer just keeps getting thicker and thicker.
But there is nothing that is being done about regulating pollution from the brick kilns in the industrial area. Going by the sanctioned brick kilns within 10 km of the Neemrana industrial area by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB), only 35 to 40 have the consent to establish. But you can't breathe easy if you see the ground reality. On a clear day there are at least 100 brick kilns that you can see, all in a short distance of one another.
This according to the pollution control board guidelines, this is a violation of the mandatory consent under Air (prevention & control of pollution) Act 1981 (Air Act). ""Likewise even after being established, the brick kiln industry must be put to operation only after a valid consent to operate under the prescribed laws is granted. The state board has issued guidelines from time to time to facilitate the process of grant of consent and also suitably guide and advise the industry for taking appropriate measures for abatement of pollution. Any violation in this regard tantamount to a criminal offence,"" according to the RPCB.
Add to that several research studies rate pollution from brick kilns as close to silicosis and inhaling any of the pollutants can cause irritation of skin and eyes besides pulmonary diseases such as pneumoconiosis and silicosis. Besides other pollutants from the brick kiln, SPM in the flue glass, which is generated mainly due to incomplete combustion of fuel (black smoke), hydrocarbons, sulphur oxides are as harmful not just for labour working in the kilns but even those working in the RIICO industrial area nearby.
The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) team's interaction with traditional firemen have also shown that incidences of skin, lung and eye diseases are very common among the community of workers at the brick kilns. And while the local impact of pollution caused by small isolated brick kilns is not likely to be significant it is the cluster in urban centers that is the cause of concern.
On another note, considering that pollution from brick kilns is one of the major sources of carbon dioxide emission, in the light of threat from global warming control of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), this becomes an important issue in global diplomacy, more so when the Rajasthan government (RIICO) is showcasing Neemrana as an investment destination to the Japanese and other foreign companies.

"City could host demonstration centre for India, Canada JV",The Times of India (TOI),2/22/2012,NAGPUR,"NAGPUR: The city may host a 'demonstration centre' to showcase technologies developed under a scientific and industrial partnership between India and Canada.
The two countries will soon set up an India-Canada Centre at the University of British Columbia, Canada, with an investment of 15 million Canadian dollars. The 'India-Canada Centre for Innovative Multi-Disciplinary Partnership' or 'IC-Impacts' is part of a broad science and technology agreement signed between the two countries last year.
Though the research centre is coming up in Canada, the technologies developed under the joint venture will be implemented by the two countries in their own way. The technologies from the project will be showcased in India for use at a permanent demonstration centre.
Nem Kumar Banthia, project director of the centre and professor of civil engineering at University of British Columbia, told TOI that the two countries had identified five key areas of mutual interest for the collaborative programme. Banthia, who hails from Nagpur, was in the city to attend a two-day scientific conference organized by the Indian Concrete.
""Being from Nagpur I am trying my best to involve the city in the project as the 'demonstration city' where all the technologies evolving out of the research between scientists from both countries will be on permanent display for adoption by industry or any other users. If Nagpur is finalized as the 'demonstration city' it will be my contribution to my home city,"" said Banthia.
He has already received support from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) director SS Gokhale when he met him during the visit to the city.
The areas of research include improvement in drinking water quality, developing infrastructure, minimizing environment pollution from economic activities, developing alternative energy sources and research in medicine to contain infectious diseases caused by viral outbreaks and parasitic infections.
Banthia said that on the Indian front various reputed academic and R&D institutions like the Roorkee, Hyderabad, Delhi and Bombay IITs will be roped in to work with the University of British Columbia and other institutions at Toronto and Alberta. As of now the project has identified Reliance Industries and the Stewols Industry from Nagpur as industrial partners.
The proposal for IC-Impacts already submitted to the Canadian government is due for final review by representatives from the two governments on February 23.
R&D Areas Chosen
Water - Research on water quality assessment, waterborne pathogen detection, quality monitoring, water treatment and developing sewage separation infrastructure
Infrastructure - Structural condition assessment, capacity strengthening, seismic retrofitting, remediation of deterioration in infrastructure, strategic infrastructure upgrading-dams, ports, bridges and railways
Environment - Treating agricultural water pollution, reducing thermal energy production causing air pollution, developing low carbon foot print construction materials and waste water management from industries
Energy - Developing alternative energy solutions, solar cells based on thin films and improvement in photovoltaic technologies, power distribution and supply solutions

Surtis to play green Holi this time,The Times of India (TOI),03-06-2012,SURAT,"SURAT: Many people in the diamond city are gearing up to celebrate 'Green Holi' to prevent damage to the environment.
Prayas, a city-based NGO working for birds, animals and environment, will launch a unique campaign on Holi. Prayas volunteers will also go door-to-door to spread awareness about the ill effects of chemical colours.
Prayas' Darshan Desai told TOI, ""During Holi a lot of water resources are wasted. Chemical colours are detrimental to environment and cause air pollution. Besides, at many places colour packets are made by children."" He said Prayas members will gather at an open plot at Mahida Bhavan at Ichhanath and light up a solar lamp for Holi. Women will perform pooja and hold rituals around the Solar lamp. Surat Municipal Corporation and the Institution of Engineers will join Prayas in celebrating green Holi. Municipal commissioner Manoj Das will light the lamp.
Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGwill not be celebrating Holi this year.
""Most of our members and office-bearers will celebrate Holi with flowers,"" said Rohit Mehta, president, SGCCI.
Holi is a major festival for the migrant population. Many parts of the city like Athwalines, City Light, Vesu, Ghod Dod, Bhatar, Udhana, Bamroli, etc, have a sizeable population of people who have migrated from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and Haryana.
However, in these areas too, many youngsters have decided not to play Holi with colours. Rajeev Arora, a third year student from Bhatar, said, ""We are not going to play Holi with colours this time. We will play Holi with plain water.""
Nidhi Chaudhary, a student in Parle Point, said, ""Chemical colours caused skin allergy to me last time. I was fully cured of it only after one month. This year, I am not going to play with colours.""
Another reason for not many youngsters indulging in the festival this time is the ongoing board exams for class X and XII.

"City sizzles, cops sweat it out",The Times of India (TOI),4/22/2012,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: The city huffed, puffed and panted on a scorching Saturday when the mercury touched 39 degrees, marking the hottest day so far with summer certain to be far more punishing as we get into May. Keeping pace with the spiraling temperature, humidity, too, clocked high, making life miserable for those who had ventured out. The hot spell is likely to continue for the next 48 hours, at least, according to the Met office. But don't despair for there's still time for nor'westers to return and provide a cool relief.
Roads wore a deserted look in the afternoon. Pedestrians scurried for sheds even as thousands took refuge in the cool comforts of shopping malls.
Explaining the discomfort that has been building up over the last few days, weather officials said the cyclical ""peaks"" were to be blamed for the blistering spell. ""Summer has arrived, so temperatures will soar now. There are peak periods when the temperature and humidity climb sharply, making it extremely uncomfortable. These are followed by periods of slide when the mercury drops. We are now going through a peak, which is why it has been so uncomfortable. But there's still time for nor'westers to hit. When they do, we can expect a cooler spell,"" said GC Debnath, director, Alipore weather office.
A trough line that extended from Madhya Pradesh to the Orissa coastline triggered successive nor'westers in Kolkata earlier this month. It kept the temperature down for a while. ""You need favourable conditions for a nor'wester to develop. Low pressure over the Chhotanagpur plateau in Bihar has to draw in moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal. When temperature shoots, like it did over the last few days, there is always the possibility of that happening. But there are other factors which could come in the way. So, it's difficult to predict when the next nor'wester is going to strike. But we still have time,"" said V Pradhan, deputy director of metereology.
Weathermen kept an eye on the doppler radar which tracks storm movements. But it had nothing exciting to show. Satellite pictures, too, painted a grim picture with no cloud movement in sight. ""It could change, though, and we can predict a squall at least 12 hours in advance using the doppler radar,"" added Pradhan.
While people scurried indoors amid soaring temperature and humidity levels, those entrusted with managing traffic on the streets of Kolkata had little respite. Standing in the middle of black-topped roads with heavy helmets on their heads for hours on end, kiosks of our traffic cops at important intersections lack even the most basic of amenities like fans and water-bottles in spite of instructions from chief minister Mamata Banerjee.
A peek into the kiosks revealed a messy sight. There are fans in some of the booths but few are in working condition. According to the cops, barely two out of 8-10 booths have fans in working condition. Small pouches of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) are provided to the men on duty but they provide little succour in the stifling conditions when even a few minutes at a time under a fan can help.
No wonder, authorities chose this time of the year to hold a recruitment rally for constables at the city's race course. They had probably kept in mind the working conditions that the constables will have to put up with, once recruited.
""The conditions are horrible. We have to be on the street for hours but there is no place where we can grab a few minutes rest. The fans in the kiosks don't work and the insides seem like heat chambers. There isn't any supply of water even. We can't approach the CM by ourselves. When we take up the matter with the OC or DC, they ignore us. After all, they don't have to work in such conditions,"" a constable at the busy Park Street-J L Nehru Road crossing said.
Some of the cops say that their duty-hours on the street stretch from 11.30 am to 5.30 pm. According to them, given the inclement weather and air pollution they have to put up with, the average life expectancy after retirement is rarely more than a few years. ""We never had fans here. We have spent several summers under extremely poor conditions here. Sometimes we seek shelter under the umbrellas provided to us but one can't work that way. Earlier, we used to be given packets of glucose. Now, we get ORS pouches. It doesn't help much,"" said a policeman posted at the important Esplanade crossing.
Meanwhile, the candidates at the race course were also fuming. They had turned up for the rally before 7 am and would remain there till after 7 pm. In the interim period, they would have to prove their capability by running 1,600 metres in six and a half minutes.
""The rally should have been held under better weather conditions. There aren't even basic amenities like water here. All this is taking a toll on our fitness,"" a candidate said.

Pune to get its own list of natural heritage sites,The Times of India (TOI),5/20/2012,PUNE,"PUNE: The city will soon have its own list of natural heritage sites, with the city-based Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage working on the project, which is being supported by the Pune Municipal Corporation. The list will include such important sites like the confluence of the Mula-Mutha rivers, the Hamunan tekdi with its indigenous tree species and the quarry lake, which is visited by bird of varied species, old or rare or endangered trees scattered in the city, parks that have old ficus trees, lakes visited by migratory birds, breeding and nesting sites of birds, among other locations.
Once the INTACH, Pune chapter, an NGO dedicated to conserving rich and diverse natural and man-made heritage, completes documenting and listings the sites and is made official by the PMC, these sites, rich in biodiversity or with cultural, aesthetic or ecological values, will be conserved.
Currently, Pune does not have a natural heritage list.
Supriya Goturkar Mahabaleshwarkar, coordinator, INTACH Pune, told TOI that the Pune natural heritage list covers natural heritage sites in the PMC areas and also in the 23 villages merged in the Pune city limits. The list includes rivers, hills, old and rare trees, lakes, habitat of fauna and flora of endemic species that are restricted in this particular area, streams, water channels, natural vegetation, water bodies, hill tops, among others.
""The documentation involves site visits, study of the area, documentation and also interviews with experts and locals. The listing divulges details on conservation significance, threats, cultural aspects, involvement of agency or community involvement for its protection, among others. It will also look at traditional practices of conservation, cultural traditions like myths, folklore and so on,"" she said.
Mahabaleshwarkar said natural heritage consists of terrestrial or aquatic sites or features including riverine, wetland, coastal or marine areas. ""The natural areas in Pune, though highly impacted are still its greatest assets. The hills, lakes, rivers and tanks, and wooded areas are not just beautiful or places for recreation - they act as the lungs of the city, absorbing noise, and tempering the heat of summer. They are also sinks for air and water pollution. These sites deserve conservation action,"" she pointed out.
""The Project is funded by the INTACH and the PMC. At present, we are compiling the list and it will be completed in couple of month's time,"" Mahabaleshwarkar said.
Shyaam Dhavalaey, deputy city engineer, heritage cell, PMC, said the natural heritage site list will be finalised by the heritage committee formed by the PMC. ""The list will then come to the PMC and we will take up conservation measures in these selected sites. At present, PMC does not have a natural heritage site list, though the civic body has a list of heritage structures,'' he said.
Natural Heritage comprise of sites of:
* Ecological and biological significance
* Areas having natural vegetation of cultural significance - sacred groves, water bodies, hill tops
* Areas associated with cultural, religious beliefs and practices
* Natural landscapes of aesthetic and recreational value

Teachers' colony promised respite from plastic by MLA,The Times of India (TOI),6/24/2012,HYDERABAD,"HYDERABAD: Residents of Shastripuram, keen on securing a pollution-free neighbourhood, registered their protest against plastic units operating in their area with the local MLA and government officials who came to survey the residential colony on Saturday.
In these columns TOI had earlier highlighted the plight of the residents of Shastripuram, which is Hyderabad's biggest residential colony. The residents have been up in arms against plastic units located in their neighborhood which have been steadily turning the streets into plastic dump-yards, and polluting air and water.
After the attention of senior officials of the GHMC and PCB was drawn to this menace recently, the residents were promised respite. The GHMC had promised to clean the streets and issue notices to factory owners claiming that many of them were operating without licenses. But much to the resident's dismay, the municipality has only superficially cleaned the streets and is yet to make a move against the plastic unit owners. Vexed with the callous attitude of the officials, the residents sought the assistance of Rajendra Nagar legislator T Prakash Goud.
Mohammed Asif, a resident of the area said, ""The local MLA enquired from the officials of both GHMC and electricity department why the units were allowed to function. At this, the electricity officials replied that it was the duty of GHMC officials to write to the electricity department regarding halting supply of power to the units. The deputy commissioner circle 7 has promised to write to electricity department by Monday.""
The residents also informed that they had moved the SHRC this earlier week alleging that their right to live was being violated. The commission has reportedly admitted their plea.
""We are trying everything to secure a clean area to live in. Shastripuram is a residential area as per the city layout and stands on 284 acres. Its size makes it the second largest residential colony in the state and the biggest in the city. If we do not get respite through the SHRC or the municipality, we will have to move the court,"" Asif ruefully added.

He further said: """"Karnataka, especially Bangalore and surrounding areas receive two monsoons. At present the southwest monsoon is active in Coastal areas. From October to December we receive rains from North east monsoon, which is likely to be normal this year.""""
He also said that while Arabian sea brings rains in coastal areas of state, interior region get rains from the Bay of Bengal. """"We need not panic as situation is favourable to receive good rains later this month. Interior parts of state will get rains till August end,"""" he said.
Rajegowda also pointed out on need for better system to make weather prediction. """"Since 2006 India has adopted several new methods for weather prediction and we get about 82% correct predictions, but like USA and UK we need equipments which will help in getting 100% correct prediction,"""" he said.
He also pointed out on severe ill effects of global warming. """"High rate of global warming is affecting the climate worldwide, leading to high fluctuation in temperature. For example July has never been so warm in Bangalore, but we are experiencing it somehow and this is majorly because of global warming. Carbon components released from Industrial waste are polluting the air drastically and thereby creating imbalance in natural climate. We need to be sensitive towards the Eco system,"""" said Rajegowda.

Worried officials postpone public hearing on bio-fuel project,The Times of India (TOI),08-02-2012,HYDERABAD,"Poosapatirega (Vizianagaram): Fearing violence, the district authorities on Wednesday postponed a public hearing on the Rs 50-crore Veda bio-fuel project here at Nadipalli. Veda Bio-fuel Private Limited is planning to set up a new distillery project in Nadipalli to manufacture ethanol or industrial alcohol.
Additional SP T Mohana Rao reportedly expressed his inability to provide security for the public hearing after the intelligence cops received information about gathering of over 2,000 agitators from Kothakopparla, Erukonda and Nadipally villages at the public hearing site. He reportedly requested the district authorities and the company management to postpone the public hearing as the situation could go out of control and lead to violent incidents with the people of three villagers opposing to the setting up of the new plant.
Environmentalists allege that the EIA report on the Veda plant is misleading. Environmentalist Venkata Ratnam said the mandal is heavily polluted and any fresh attempts to set up another polluting unit would pose danger to the residents of the area.
He said there are four highly polluting industrial units in and around Nadipalli. ""All these units are polluting land, water and air causing health problems to the villagers and polluting the ground water,"" he said.
An activist against the new plant alleged that the EIA report talks about drawing water from the local ground water aquifers and the nearby Champavati river for the Veda project. ""How could they allow drawal of water for a private project,"" he asked.

HC asks state to clarify stand on polluting trucks,The Times of India (TOI),9/21/2012,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: While some measures have been taken to phase out 15-year-old passenger carrying commercial vehicles, no steps seem to have been taken to curb the movement of old trucks that pollute the air, particularly at night, when they are allowed within the city limits. On Thursday, the Calcutta high court directed the state transport secretary to file an affidavit on what steps have been taken to phase out 15-year-old goods vehicles. The affidavit will have to be submitted within two weeks.
On July 18, 2008, the high court passed an order banning 15-year-old vehicles and two-stroke auto-rickshaws. Environment activist Subhas Datta, who was the petitioner, approached the court recently and alleged that the state government had not taken any steps in recent years to phase out vehicles that have crossed the deadline. The state was directed to file a report on the issue.
In the report that was submitted on September 5, 2012, the state mentioned that apart from other vehicles, there are 30,000 trucks which are over 15 years old. However, there was no mention of what steps had been taken to phase them out.
Datta told the court that many of these trucks enter the city limits at night and emit pollutants. He also submitted a report by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board which stated that pollution levels during the night are higher than during the day between September and February. Much of this had to do with the trucks that enter the city limits, he submitted. After hearing this, the division bench of Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta and Justice Asim Kumar Mondal directed the transport secretary to file the affidavit.
The court also directed the transport secretary to ask auto-rickshaw associations to appear before it and submit their stand on the existing situation. Datta, in his petition, had stated that two-stroke autos continue to ply in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area in spite of the court’s orders.
He had also submitted that the auto-rickshaws refuse to abide by rules and carry more passengers than they are supposed to. The court had then directed that a list of auto-rickshaw associations be drawn out and they be allowed to submit their stand.
Accordingly, a list of 10 associations was drawn and submitted to the court on Thursday. After going through it, the court directed the transport secretary to ask office bearers of these associations to appear before it.

"Voice out walkability index in public, log on to a web application",The Times of India (TOI),10/13/2012,BANGALORE,"BANGALORE: Do you want to voice out your civic grievances in public? Eager to share ideas on making the daily walk safer, smoother and more pleasant? Want to know if your city is more 'walkable' than others?
Simply log on to a free walkability aplication now available on Google, enabled to give 'walkers' the power to score or rate a footpath, sidewalk, or pedestrian area. This will soon be followed with an access to post photos while pedestrians are on their daily walk.
While walking is the most low emission mode of transport, up to seventy percent of road fatalities in Asia involve pedestrians. Safe and adequate walking facilities need to be prioritized as a lot of pedestrian lives are at stake. The silent walking majority in our community must be allowed to speak out, that is the reason we came out with this web application,"" said Glynda Bathan, Deputy Executive Director of Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-Asia).
The Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-Asia) promotes better air quality and livable cities by translating knowledge to policies and actions that reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from transport, energy and other sectors. CAI-Asia was established in 2001 by the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and USAID. Since 2007, this multi-stakeholder initiative is a registered UN Type II Partnership with more than 230 organizational members and eight Country Networks
Till date, CAI-Asia has conducted widely publicized walkability assessment reports in 23 Asian cities and continues to make better walking infrastructures part of the development agenda of Asian cities with support from Asian Development Bank, Shakti Foundation and many other partner organizations.
Prior to the walkability app, CAI-Asia created a dedicated Walkability Asia website and Facebook page that communicates improvements in walkability in Asian countries, provides a broad list of sources that will enable public participation and guide public and private sector decision-making towards sound policy benefiting pedestrians.
The free walkability app available at www.bit.ly/QX5LZ0;- not only allows you to measure the walkability of a street but also lets you share the feedback with your friends and family.
Parthaa Bosu, Representative of the CA-Asia India Office, stated that this application is the first of its kind, developed with the idea to promote and communicate that safe walking is everyone's right - regardless of age, gender, education and background.

"Winter sees spurt in respiratory tract infections, skin problems",The Times of India (TOI),11/22/2012,PUNE,"PUNE: With the onset of winter and sudden drop in temperature, scores of people are falling ill with upper respiratory tract infections, asthma and skin-related problems. The number of cases have increased by 20 to 40% in hospitals.
Apart from the high air pollution in city, climate change has aggravated blood pressure and heart problems. Doctors warn that people with rheumatoid arthritis and neurological problems who have muscle spasticity (stiffness) should take additional precaution.
Sanjay Agarwal, head of the department of medicine at Ruby Hall Clinic, and senior consultant, medicine, Jehangir hospital, told TOI that patients with chest infections, respiratory problems and asthmatic problems are on the rise during this winter period. There is an increase in bronchitis cases too. ""Climate change triggers these cases and we are experiencing weather-related problems. One should report early with the onset of symptoms,'' he said.
Chandrashekhar Phansalkar, consulting physician, Ratna Memorial Hospital, said when the body is exposed to cold weather, we produce more heat and the energy is spend overcoming this cold. Thus, immunity drops. Persons with less immunity, such as elderly people and diabetics, are more prone to diseases. The dry cold weather in Pune aggravates asthma problems.
The other common problems are skin-related problems, such as infections, allergy, itching and rashes. Dry skin has less resistance when compared to healthy skin, he said.
Phansalkar said that because of the high air pollution in the city, the polluted air remain stagnated at the lower level. As repiratory problems increase, people come with complaints such as cold, sore throat, cough and sneezing, among others. When the weather is cold, the blood vessels get constricted. If a patient is already suffering from blood pressure and heart diseases, the sudden exposure to cold weather can lead to complications.
Phansalkar said that patients with rheumatoid arthritis should take care. Lack of movement in joint and cold weather can aggravate the problem. One should do good exercise of joints and keep themselves warm. Also, people with neurological problems, who have muscle spasticity or stiffness, should take similar additional precaution during this period.
On similar lines, Mahendra Dhadke, senior consultant medicine, Aditya Birla memorial hospital, said there has been an increase in about 30-40% increase in cases during this period.
There is a spurt in airborne infections. ""The drop in temperature aggravates pneumonia and acute bronchitis. One who is prone to arthritis can get infections too. So people with arthritis should keep themselves warm and consult the doctor early. Patients with pneumonia, diabetes and heart diseases should also get vaccinated,'' he said.
Abhijeet P Joshi, consultant physician, Joshi Hospital, said the incidences of cold and cough, allergy and viral infections have gone up. ""In the last three weeks, there has been an increase in around 20% such cases. We usually ask the patients to keep themselves hydrated throughout the day, rest and, if needed, give anti-histamines that specifically prevent allergic reactions,'' he said.
This winter season, pediatricians are also seeing an increase in cough and cold among children. Jayant Joshi, consultant pediatrician, Gupte Hospital, said, ""over the last 4-5 days, there has been a rise in cold and cough incidences among children. But it is not significant and rarely is associated with fever or infection. Also, these cases were reported after one week of Diwali because of change in eating pattern and inhalation of smoke from firecrackers. The elders should follow the change in weather and keep their children warm,'' he said.
Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions such as avoiding cold food, keeping warm, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, maintaining moisture in the skin and maintaining personal hygiene.

Cracker sale dips as awareness goes up,The Times of India (TOI),11/16/2012,NAGPUR,"NAGPUR: Greater awareness about eco-friendly Diwali and runaway prices of crackers have left the cracker vendors reporting a lukewarm sales this Diwali. Since the past few years, dealers in firecrackers clock in a total turnover of over Rs 10 crore, or about 1% of the annual budget of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). This year, however, business is down by about 20%, say traders.
They blame it mainly on the awareness drives by schools other agencies, against sound and air pollution created due to bursting of crackers. Even the state's environment minister Sanjay Deotale had circulated voice messages on similar lines. Repeated publicity against crackers has succeeded in creating children's disinterest in crackers that was reflected in the sales.
Curbs on decibel capacity of crackers have led to the sales of bombs in particular come down to abysmal levels, said the traders. Although inflation also played its role apart from strict enforcement by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). Traders also do not deny the presence of banned Chinese crackers in the market, even as they deny selling those themselves. There are 10 major wholesalers in the city with around 900 retailers who operate on a temporary licence issued every season by the district administration.
The wholesalers have increased their rates to almost retail levels leading retailers, who set up small shops in different localities, to keep their stocks low, added a small trader. ""We were expecting better sales this year as the festival was falling in the middle of the month. Last time, it was at month's end but the sales were good, so much more was expected this time but it turned out to be a dull Diwali,"" said Gopaldas Balani of M/s Ishwardas and Co, one of the oldest firms dealing in firecrackers.
Balani calls it the worst Diwali in his career of 40 years. ""If Diwali comes in middle of a month, people have ample money in their hands with bonus amounts received a week or two ago. We were expecting that the rush would be unmanageable and the shop may have to be kept open till 10 in the night. But we wound up by 8pm,"" he said.
The decibel levels of bombs have been kept down to 125. Low sound levels have also reduced the interest in bombs which used to be a big fad earlier. There was a time when crackers like the Laxmi Bomb or Sutli Bomb were popular items but lately the sales have gone down to negligible levels,"" he said.
Viru Balani of M/s Virat Crackers next door said, ""even children coming to the shop this year were not so keen. Normally, the budget of a good customer ranges up to Rs 5,000. There were some regular patrons who restricted their purchases this year to less than half the amount spent last Diwali."" He said that similar situation was reported in many other parts of the country mainly due to campaign against crackers. However, it must be considered that the industry, from manufacturers in Sivakasi to local traders in different cities, employed a large number of workers, he added.
Many retailers are also buying directly from a couple of major dealers in Khamgaon and Akola and that has also brought down the local wholesalers' sales, said Ashok Chandak of Chandak Fataka.

Bus karo! Cars hog 85% of Mumbai roads,The Times of India (TOI),01-07-2013,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: If you are sick of Mumbai’s perennially clogged traffic, it is perhaps time to demand a better public bus network. After all, private vehicles hog more than 85% of road space during peak hours though they ferry only a few more people than buses which occupy not more than 7% of roads. This is true for both the city and suburbs, shows an ongoing analysis conducted by the Mumbai Environmental Social Network (MESN) which is among the transport organizations demanding that buses be given priority on Mumbai’s roads.
The group observed traffic flows at peak hour across 19 spots in the city. The Kalanagar junction, the converging point for traffic from the eastern and western suburbs is a case in point. During peak hours, there were 48 times more private vehicles (cars, taxis, autorickshaws and bikes) plying the road than buses. They could be blamed for the bumper-to-bumper traffic taking up as they did 86% of the road space vis-a-vis buses which occupied a mere 6%. This even though buses ferried 41% of people against the 59% ferried by private vehicles. In fact, at some junctions like Citylight in Mahim, private vehicles took up more space but ferried fewer people than buses. They clogged 82% of roads to ferry 35% of commuters while buses which took 16% of space carried nearly 65% of people.
Getting Mumbaikars out of their cars and into buses or shared transport will not only ease the traffic snarls but also lower emission and pollution considerably, say transport experts.
“Our analysis is meant to encourage planners to facilitate dedicated bus lanes, where bus traffic is higher,” said Ashok Datar of the MESN, pointing out that policymakers needed to change their focus from moving vehicles to moving people.
The analysis comes at a time when travelling urban think tank BMW Guggenheim Lab is engaging Mumbaikars in finding transport solutions for the city. The Lab team is shocked at the skewed transport planning priorities. “Nearly 20% of the city’s transport investment goes into the Bandra Worli sealink, though it has a minuscule number of users. Future investment should be cut down to two per cent and the difference invested in public transport,” said Yuval Zohar, an architect with the Lab. About one million cars were added to Mumbai roads in the last 10 years, while buses correspondingly increased by only 1,500, say experts.
Other cities are already making a shift from pro-car infrastructure towards policies which boost public transport networks. Bus rapid transit systems (BRTS) are in place in 25 Asian cities including Delhi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot. “Limiting the number of cars on the roads and making public transport more comfortable will increase the road space. It will in turn increase the traffic speed and reduce congestion and air pollution,” said Rishi Aggarwal, environmentalist and researcher at Observer Research Foundation. Vivek Phansalkar, joint commissioner of police (traffic) too believes Mumbai has to mandatorily move towards public transport and BRTS could prove a solution.
Globally, cities like Los Angeles, Guangzhou and Singapore have paved the way. In LA, which is renowned as the car city of the world, an upcoming neighbourhood of about 31,000 people has pledged no parking space, given its proximity to public transport. In China, Guangzhou has put a restraint on car purchase at a cap of 5,000 cars per month, while Singapore has made it mandatory to purchase a certificate of entitlement as a pre-condition to purchasing cars. This certificate is auctioned and the revenue raked goes into developing public transport.

Nalco embarks upon green project,The Times of India (TOI),02-10-2013,BHUBANESWAR,"ANGUL: Navaratna company Nalco is all set to run its first-ever carbon sequestration project that would capture carbon dioxide using algae through Indo-Can technology, the first such venture in India to minimize warming. The algae would play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and cleaning polluted air.
Construction of the Rs 95-lakh project on the captive power plant (CPP) premises of Nalco here is in full swing and production of algae will begin in a week, Nalco sources said.
The Nalco had evinced interest to start the project after persuasion from Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB). Indo-Can Technology Solutions (ICTS) is executing the project, the fifth in the world.
Ranjan Pradhan, expert at ICTS, told TOI, ""As per the project, algae will be grown in shallow ponds and carbon dioxide from the captive power plant tapped and introduced in the pond. Being soluble in the water, carbon dioxide will get absorbed in it.""
Carbon dioxide and water are the basic requirement for algae growth and these in turn will release oxygen as a by-product, he added and claimed that by this process the rate of sequestration could be as high as 100 times of a tree system.
He said in the project, carbon dioxide emitted from the stacks is segregated and injected into shallow water ponds to expedite growth of cultured micro-algae. In the process, biomass of micro-algae doubles itself in 24 hours under optimum conditions and is harvested every 15 days.
Siddhanta Kumar Dash, member secretary of OSPCB, while on a visit to Nalco CPP recently, said, ""A few countries in the world - the US, China, Canada and Israel - have used the technology for capturing carbon. However, it has not been used for commercial purposes so far though laboratory tests have shown positive results.""
""We have taken this as a pilot project. If the project delivers the goods, we would start the project on commercial basis,"" he had added.
Reducing emission of green house gases (GHG), the main cause of global warming, is a critical environment issue confronting the world community today. The project would lead to replicating the process in a commercial scale in the industries and help the country fulfil its commitment for reducing the rate of emissions by 20% by 2020, Dash had said.
B B Nayak, general Manager of CPP, Nalco, said, ""If the project yields good results we would think of another project in future.""

Varanasi far from meeting air quality standards,The Times of India (TOI),03-01-2013,VARANASI,"VARANASI: The city, which has been witnessing a huge influx of pilgrims from Allahabad in view of Maha Kumbh, is one of the worst locations in terms of air quality, reports suggest.
""The deterioration in air quality is caused by a number of factors like vehicular exhaust and civil work such as digging of roads,"" said Prof BD Tripathi, a noted environmentalist at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Though the Government of India enacted the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 to arrest the deterioration in the air quality, Varanasi is still in the category on 'non-attainment cities' identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The CPCB has identified a list of polluted cities in which the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are violated. These cities have been identified based on ambient air quality data obtained under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP).
The CPCB's report on 'Air Quality Trends and Action Plan for Control of Air Pollution from Seventeen Cities' recorded that in general, it has been observed that NAAQS (24 hourly average) of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are violated in Varanasi. As per standards, the concentration of particulate matters should not exceed 60 microbgram/m3 (24 hourly average) in the ambient air. But the trend showed that concentrations of RSPM and SPM were 100-150 microgram/m3 and 300-400 microgram/m3 respectively. However, Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO2) standards were not violated. The Uttar Pradesh State Pollution Control Board is monitoring ambient air quality at two monitoring stations in Varanasi under NAMP. These monitoring stations are located at regional office of UPSPCB and Shivpur area.
According to the CPCB report, like other ancient cities of India, the traffic pattern is characterized by intermixing of slow and fast moving vehicles, passing of inter and intra city traffic through the busy portions of city, erratic driving and violation of the traffic rules and regulations. Typical characteristics of the roads are improper roads geometries, encroachments, inadequate road widths and road networks. These factors either singularly or in combinations are responsible for frequent and long traffic jams in the city. The areas, which are very sensitive from this point of view are in and around Godolia, Maidagain, Bhelupur, Sonarpura, Nadesar, Cantt. Sigra. Varanasi being a place of religious, historical and tourist importance, also enjoys the status of an important place in the production of various handicraft items like silk sarees, carpets, jari jamdani, rags, and customary knitting of jamavars. The real industrial development started taking place in the city after 1950. The major portion of the SSI units belong to the categories of general engineering, metal processing and products, machinery parts followed by textile products including wool, silk, cotton and jute. The large scale industry of national and international importance is Diesel Locomotive Works.
According to report, levels of RSPM exceed the prescribed standards in most cities. One of the major sources of high RSPM levels is vehicles. The vehicular population is increasing exponentially in many cities. This is the single major factor for high RSPM levels. The reason for high particulate matter levels may be vehicles, engine gensets, small scale industries, biomass incineration, boilers and emission from power plants, re-suspension of traffic dust, commercial and domestic use of fuels. Similarly the levels of SPM also exceed the prescribed standards in most of the cities. The sources of SPM include, vehicles, natural dust, industries such as thermal power plants, sugar, cement, re-suspension of dust, refuse burning.
Fast Fact:
(A) National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP)
The Central Pollution Control Board initiated National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (NAAQM) programme in 1984 with 7 stations at Agra and Anpara. Subsequently the programme was renamed as National Air Monitoring Programme (NAMP). The number of monitoring stations under NAMP has increased, steadily, to 308 operating stations by 2006 covering 115 cities/towns in 25 States and 4 Union Territories of the country.
(B) Monitoring Locations and Parameters
Under NAMP, four air pollutants -Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen as NO2 and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM/PM10), have been identified for regular monitoring at all the locations.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board hearing on UltraTechruns into fresh trouble,The Times of India (TOI),04-03-2013,NAGPUR,"NAGPUR: The plan of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to hold the second public hearing for provision of environmental clearance to UltraTech Cement's grinding unit near Mouda has run into fresh trouble. Residents of the affected villages are again saying that they will oppose the hearing slated to be held on April 18 as they were not informed.
The first public hearing fixed on February 15 had to be cancelled following strong opposition from residents of nearby villagers. Sarpanchs of Tharsa and Ashti-Navegaon villages, where the plant is coming up, said they had not received public hearing notice a month before it was scheduled, which was mandatory as per the procedure. Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal had backed the protestors.
This time, MPCB had informed the gram panchayats of Tharsa and Ashti-Nawegaon only. The agency's contention is that the land of residents of only these two villages was being acquired for the plant.
However, environmentalist Sudhir Paliwal termed this as wrong interpretation of law. ""The cement plant will cause air, water and soil pollution in a radius of at least 10km. There the residents of all the ten villages lying in this area should have been informed. Many farmers of Tarsa and Ashti-Nawegaon have sold their land. They won't be affected by pollution. The ones who are not moving out will be the victims of pollution,"" he pointed out. He said the norms of ministry of environment and forests (MoEF)
Suraj Kamble of Chacher village echoed similar sentiments. ""Khaparkheda and Koradi power plants have ruined the farmers. I don't want any cement plant in this area. I am a poor man and depend solely on my five acre farm. If the yield goes down how will I feed my family,"" he asked.
Farmer leader Sanjay Saktekar, who had played a major role in getting the first hearing cancelled, said not only all the affected villagers had not been informed but touts had misled farmers to buy their land at low rates and then sold it to UltraTech for a handsome profit.
Pratap Goswami of Kisan Manch said his organization would also strongly oppose the hearing as the farmers of other villagers had not been informed. ""The plant will destroy the most fertile tract of Nagpur district. MIDC says it has acres of vacant land, then why new factories do not come up there,"" he asked. When contacted, an MPCB official said all the norms had been followed.
UltraTech has proposed a 2.0 MTPA cement grinding unit and 12 MW captive power plant in Ashti, 35km from Kanhan. The areas of concern about the plant include irrigated lands being acquired, air pollution threatening green fields and local water bodies, rivers and groundwater resources.

Dusty road takes zing out of Panambur beach visit,The Times of India (TOI),5/21/2013,MANGALORE,"MANGALORE: Every year lakhs of tourists from across the country and abroad arrive at Panambur beach on holidays. The Dakshina Kannada district administration has taken several initiatives in association with the department of tourism to tap the tourist potential of the beach. However the dusty approach road that connects the National Highway to the beach is a disappointment.
Every day several heavy trucks carrying coal, urea, timber and other goods ply on the road which belongs to the New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT). As a result, the road becomes dusty and it becomes very difficult for tourists to walk to the beach.
Nagarika Hitharakshana Samiti, Surathkal, vice-president Pushparaj Shetty told TOI that trucks plying on it are spoiling the approach road. ""Hundreds of tourists as well as others use the road. The trucks to the port are polluting the air and spoiling the road. There should be separate roads for trucks and other vehicles. When the number of tourists is on the rise, the possibilities of accident too are more. Goods, mainly coal and urea, fall on the road from trucks. The port authorities should take initiatives to provide a cleaner road,"" he said.
Sathish Kumar, a tourist, said, that tourist taxi drivers refuse to go to Panambur beach because of the dirt on the approach road. ""They say that they have to clean up their tyres after every time to go to the beach. You cannot walk on the stretch because of the dust,"" he said.

"If Metro-III meets its deadline, Mumbai will save Rs 1.60cr fuel daily by 2021",The Times of India (TOI),6/29/2013,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: If Metro-III, the city's third 33.5km underground rail link between Colaba and Seepz, chugs off by 2020, over 4.60 lakh and 6.65 lakh vehicle trips of Mumbaikars will be saved daily and fuel worth around Rs 1.60 crore and Rs 2.30 crore will also be saved by 2021 and 2041 respectively.
This will help the city fetch lakhs of rupees daily as carbon credit for saving carbon emission, officials said.
The third metro, with 27 stations, received the all-important Union government nod for funding from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Thursday.
A state government study, suggesting the prospective impact of Metro-III, and carried out with help from Indian Railways, estimated that if the project is up and running by 2021 it will save total 4.60 lakh vehicular journeys on the roads made by cars, taxis, buses and autorickshaws. Similarly by 2031 and 2041 such 5.55 lakh and 6.65 lakh journeys will reduce on the city's roads. The figures have been derived the figures after calculating the expected rise in vehicles and commuters, and the shift of ridership to the third metro.
""The Metro will reduce 55 lakh km, 67 lakh km and 81 lakh km of daily journeys of vehicles by 2021, 2031 and 2041 respectively. It will ultimately reduce consumption of fuel worth Rs1.60 crore, Rs1.92 crore and Rs2.30 crore daily,"" the findings suggested.
""Ultimately, reduction in emission of toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulate matter will reduce the city's air pollution. It will eventually help fetch carbon credit worth over Rs28 lakh, Rs34 lakh and Rs41 lakh everyday in 2021, 2031 and 2041 respectively,"" it stated.
Mantralaya officials said the city would not need to buy 450 buses if the Metro comes up by 2020. ""Similarly, around 10% newer roads of 182km length planned for Mumbai, will not be required,"" the report added.
The Union urban development ministry had on June 20 withdrawn a proposal on the Metro-III from the Cabinet. Sources said he found a typographical error in the project cost. The figure circulated at the meeting was less than the estimated cost.

"Pimpalkutta villagers, NGO plant 3,000 saplings",The Times of India (TOI),7/31/2013,AURANGABAD,"AURANGABAD: Around 1,500 people, including residents and members of an NGO, participated in a drive on Sunday and planted 3,000 medicinal saplings in Pimpalkutta village, around 35 km from here.
Bhausaheb Namdeo Dabhade, deputy sarpanch of the village, said that with the help of NGO Gayatri Chetana Kendra, 80 different kinds of rare medicinal plants such as guggul, bibba, kuda, ritha, chirak, anwala, nirgondi, kumbha, bahawa and toran were planted at a place developed for the purpose called 'Shriram Smrutivan'.
""Moreover, effort to maintain ecological balance was also initiated,"" said Rajesh Tank, a member of the NGO.
""The huge industrial complexes, rapid urbanization, deforestation, air and water pollution, ozone-depletion, radioactive wastes have disturbed and destabilized the natural harmony of human, animal and plant life cycles. The ecological imbalance is posing a threat not only to human survival, but to environment as a whole. Hence, yadnya, which is a viable cure for ecological imbalance, was performed,"" he said.
""Experimental studies have shown that yadnya or agnihotra creates a pure, hygienic, nutritional and healing atmosphere. Researchers from the field of microbiology have observed that medicinal fumes emanating from the process of agnihotra are bacteriostatic in nature. They eradicate bacteria and micro-organisms, which are the root causes of illness and diseases,"" he added.
Dabhade said the saplings would be watered through drip irrigation for which infrastructure has been set up by the local gram panchayat. ""Encouraged by our endeavour, five more villages including Dhasla, Rampuri, Peerwadi, Sayedpur and Kachnapur have shown interest in carrying out tree plantation drive,"" he said.
""We will extend all support to the villages in carrying out the drive,"" Tank said.

Tears pick up tell-tale signs of other diseases,The Times of India (TOI),8/17/2013,BANGALORE,"BANGALORE: At first look, the one-room lab on the bustling West of Chord Road looks like any other diagnostic laboratory. But the equipments has not only corrected the vision of thousands of weary-eyed Bangaloreans, specially professionals who spend long hours on the computer, but also studies tears to get a glimpse into other underlying diseases in the body.
The Tear Science Lab measures the quality of the tear film lipids essential to maintain the stability of the tear. What prompted Dr Rohit Shetty, the brain behind this lab at Narayana Nethralaya, was the increasing number of people with dry eyes in the city. ""I began to see a lot of patients complaining of blurred vision, itchiness and dry eye due to continuous strain on the eye. And the majority of cases were work-related. It's crucial to study the tear glands'' he told TOI.
The Centre for Occupational Dry Eye (CODE) provides customized treatment. The definition of dry eye is very vague, says Dr Shetty, adding that an abnormal tear lipid layer is responsible for a majority of evaporative dry eye symptoms. ""The evaluation of these glands is done by infrared meibography which shows the morphological changes. The lipiview ocular surface interferometer measures the quality of the tear film lipids essential to maintain the stability of the tear film covering the surface of the eye,'' he said.
What is dry eye?
* A chronic problem which can severely affect a patient's quality of life
* Can be either due to decreased tear production (aqueous deficiency) or increased evaporation of tears (evaporative dry eye)
* Each condition needs special evaluation and targeted treatment
* Can occur in patients of all ages
* Aggravated by long hours of computer usage, air-conditioned environments and pollution.
Online test
Login to the hospital website () and check if you have dry eyes by answering a two-minute questionnaire. The score indicates if you need medical intervention.
Detect other diseases
Dr Shetty, in collaboration with doctors in Singapore, is doing research where tears detect underlying diseases. ""Tears are representative not only of the condition of the lacrimal gland or ocular surface, but also be suggestive of disease in other parts of the body. By analyzing levels of deregulated proteins in tears, we can determine the pathways affected. These data, when correlated tightly with disease stages, can be used for disease prediction. Such information will also tell us about underlying molecular pathways affected by the disease,"" he said
As proof of concept, researchers evaluated tears from patients and performed LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy) on them. ""When we compared the detected protein profile of the patients with normal, healthy people, we obtained a fingerprint of the disease. The tear science lab will help us perform biomarker discovery and validation. This will give physicians a new set of tools to diagnose and manage disease,'' he said.

Eateries in Hauz Khas reopen,The Times of India (TOI),9/26/2013,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Four days after directing 34 restaurants in Hauz Khas village to close, the National Green Tribunal allowed most of them to reopen at once even as it imposed a number of conditions.
The bench has divided the 34 restaurants into four categories: those who've placed orders but not started installing effluent treatment plants; those who've started the installation; those who've have already installed ETPs; and those who've haven't done any of the above. The order was based on an inspection by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Tuesday.
The DPCC report said the 14 restaurants that had started the installation were allowed to reopen on the condition that they finish it within four weeks. The bench also clarified that the final decision on whether they would be allowed to operate rests with DPCC, which will test their effluent parameters after the plants are set up.
Only one restaurant had installed an ETP already; the bench asked DPCC to check its suitability. During the inspection, DPCC found that 11 eateries had placed orders for the plants, which had not been installed yet. The bench directed these 11 to pay Rs 10,000 each to the NGT bar association and gave them four weeks' time for the installation.
The remaining eight were told to stay closed as many of them were closed even during DPCC's inspection, and some had taken no steps to fulfil the requirements for DPCC's consent and installing ETPs. The bench told them to obtain DPCC's clearance and follow the policy before reopening.
The courtroom was packed with restaurant owners, who were happy and relieved on being allowed to resume business, some of whom clapped before leaving. When the bench headed by Justice P Jyothimani read out the name of the restaurant 'He Said-She Said', the observers and lawyers broke into a laugh. The names of other eateries-Thirty Nine, Iron Curtain and Cashmere-left them equally amused. ""You are happy about foreign words, is it?"" the judge said in a lighter vein.
The proceedings were leavened by comic accusations. The defence lawyer said being a vegetarian he never ate at Hauz Khas Village, though the petitioner's lawyer must have tasted ""non-vegetarian"" food there. An observer clarified there was a vegetarian, south Indian restaurant as well.
The bench said it reconsidered the closure order as these restaurants are connected to the drainage. It clarified that none of the restaurants can use groundwater. Many of the restaurants were using both groundwater and Delhi Jal Board connection at the time of inspection.
The DPCC member secretary, Sandeep Mishra, had told the court that DPCC was severly understaffed and monitoring restaurants across the city was not possible. The bench took note of it and directed the government to hire more scientists.
It added that a committee be set up to look into the hotels and restaurant sector. It will include representatives from New Delhi Municipal Council, municipal corporations of Delhi, National Production Council, Central Ground Water Authority and Delhi Development Authority; the DPCC member secretary will be convener. It will look into measures to control air and water pollution, solid waste management, water conservation, sanitation and hygiene of hotels and restaurants and file its report within two months.
On September 20, the tribunal ordered closure of 34 eateries for operating without the consent of DPCC, discharging untreated effluents in the sewers and drawing groundwater.

​Ragpickers want recognition,The Times of India (TOI),10/24/2013,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Kabadiwalas and ragpickers in the capital have found themselves sidelined by the draft municipal solid waste rules 2013 which does not recognize their contribution to the city&rsquo;s waste management.
Despite playing a major role in collection and recycling of waste in cities, their work is mentioned only once in the draft rules which say the municipal body can engage agencies and groups &ldquo;including ragpickers&rdquo; in collection of waste from homes, leaving it to the sweet will of the corporation to decide whether or not they will avail their service at all.
The community is also disturbed by the portrayal of waste-to-energy plants in the draft as one of the main methods of managing waste.
Apart from serious air pollution concerns, members are concerned that this would lead to &ldquo;privatization&rdquo; of waste management. The All India Kabadi Mazdoor Mahasangh organized a meeting on Wednesday, also attended by waste management experts, which thrashed out a set of demands.
Instead of leaving all aspects of waste management to municipal bodies, which ends up in it being transported to landfills, the meeting focused on &ldquo;decentralizing&rdquo; the process and dealing with the waste at the ward level.
However, experts say it will take time to be implemented. At the core of this process is waste segregation at source which is currently not being practised in Delhi. While dry waste can be handed over directly to the ragpicker by residents, wet waste may be recycled to compost. This will not just protect the waste handling community but also reduce
investments in pollution-causing waste-to-energy plants. All residents need to do is not mix dry and wet waste since that makes extraction of usable waste nearly impossible. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also very undignified for us to sort out usable things with our hands from the filth,&rdquo; said Meena, a ragpicker.
&ldquo;Collection and segregation of waste can obviously be done by ragpickers. There seems to be class bias in the way the rules don&rsquo;t acknowledge the existing waste management players. Why only private companies? It&rsquo;s the primary right of the unorganized sector to continue work as ragpickers,&rdquo; said Ravi Agarwal, founder director of Toxics Link, an environmental NGO.
Okhla landfill used to have 300 to 400 people working to recover usable waste but now only about 80 ragpickers go there since the work of managing waste has gone to private companies. &ldquo;People who make these rules focus only on the emission standards and the environmental aspects but not at the social cost. Waste can be managed safely by the informal sector,&rdquo; Agarwal said.
&ldquo;The Central Pollution Control Board&rsquo;s technical evaluation has already shown that these plants release dioxins and furans which are extremely toxic,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;We are demanding that ragpickers be given the responsibility of collecting and segregating waste. We have already found that 80% of waste is usable and 30% is recyclable. Then why should waste be sent to the plants? The process should be decentralized and composting should be encouraged,&rdquo; Shashi Bhushan of the Kabadi Mazdoor Mahasangh said.

"Celebrate, but adhere to rules: Police",The Times of India (TOI),11-01-2013,COIMBATORE,"COIMBATORE: Booming sounds of firecrackers started echoing in the city from Thursday evening as the city residents started Diwali celebrations with full gusto. The district administration and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) have issued advisory to the residents warning strict action against those bursting high decibel crackers in silent zones like adjacent to hospitals and medical care facilities. The violators will be taken into custody and be fined up to RS 1000.
""We have issued the advisory to the public to ensure that there is minimum noise pollution and public discomfort due to bursting of crackers. The action will be taken against the violators through police department while the pollution control board will keep a check on the decibel level of noise pollution in the city,"" said Coimbatore district collector Archana Patnaik.
The district administration and PCB has asked the city residents to refrain from bursting crackers between 10pm and 6am. Residents have been advised not to burst crackers in congested streets and light rocket crackers near slum settlements to avoid fire mishaps.
""We are planning to book them under the City Police Act and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. We are planning to enforce this strictly here in the city,"" said Coimbatore city police commissioner AK Viswanathan.
Though the pollution control board officials said strict action would be taken against those who violate the restrictions, they also said that there was very little they could do except creating awareness among the city residents.
""We have issued a list of guidelines on the basis of the Supreme Court order to impose a ban on bursting cracker between 10pm and 6am. We are also taking air and noise pollution levels in the city before and after Diwali,""said P Asokan, district environment engineer, Coimbatore (north).
The fire and rescue services department and 108 ambulance services unit will be on high alert from Friday morning to ensure effective response to any festival related emergency in the city. As per the statistics compiled by GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute operating 108 emergency ambulance services, assault, vehicular and non vehicular trauma related emergencies were always on the rise during the days before and after Diwali during the last two years. The number of accident related cases has also registered an increase on Diwal in the city during the last two years. They added that fire mishap emergency calls have been low when compared to these emergency cases.
""We usually get a 30% increase in the emergency calls during Diwali compared to normal days. We have identified hot spots in the city and outskirts to redeploy and position our ambulances on Diwali day. We will be on Diwali alert from Friday to Sunday,"" said H Mohan, regional manager (operations), GVK EMRI, Coimbatore.
According to M Shahul Hameed, deputy director, fire and rescue services, mobilisation orders will be issued to all firemen from 4am on Friday morning and will be in effect till Sunday evening until further orders are issued. Last year, 23 cases of fire mishaps were reported in Coimbatore and the Nilgiris for Diwali resulting in a loss of Rs 39,500 according to the fire and rescue services department.
""Most of these fire mishaps were caused by wayward rockets and mostly coconut trees were damaged in Coimbatore. There was no major fire mishap during 2012 Diwali"", he added.

More air pollution this Diwali: Maharashtra Pollution Control Board report,The Times of India (TOI),11-08-2013,POLLUTION,"NASHIK: This Diwali, there has been a rise in the air pollution levels in the city as compared to last year, according to the reports of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).
The MPCB monitors the air before and during Diwali every year to gauge the levels of air pollution during the festival. This year, it was found that there has been a significant rise in the pollution level.
Despite a dip in the sale of crackers, as observed by the president of the Nashik Firecrackers Association Jayprakash Jategaonkar, air pollution has been on the rise. The firecracker shop owners said that the sale of bigger crackers showed the maximum drop, they were unable to quantify the fall.
This year, the Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) was 176.9 microgram per cubic metre before Diwali and 236.2 microgram per cubic metre during Diwali; while the SOx (oxides of Sulphur) was 8.81 microgram per cubic meter before Diwali and 48.7 microgram per cubic meter during the festival. The NOx (oxides of Nitrogen) was 14.5 microgram per cubic meter before Diwali and 35.3 microgram after the festival.
Regional manager of the MPCB, A S Fulse said, ""There has been an increase in air pollution during Diwali as compared to last year. This could be possible because people purchased more of fancy and noiseless crackers rather than the noisy ones. The RSPM and Sulphur levels have been higher this year.""
Jagbir Singh of the Manav Utthan Manch (MuM), an NGO that conducted awareness campaigns before the festival to minimise the use of crackers, said, ""It is wrong to believe that noiseless crackers do not cause pollution. They do not cause noise pollution but they definitely cause air pollution. Sulphur oxides are very harmful. We have noticed that while there has been less noise pollution from crackers this year, people have bought fancy crackers without noise.""

'Dust is what we eat and breathe',The Times of India (TOI),12/29/2013,LUCKNOW,"KABRAI (MAHOBA): Haze is all one can see beyond 60 metres in Kabrai, a pocket of legal and illegal stone mining in Bundelkhand. The visibility reduces to zero when a stone crusher unit starts working. Green trees have grayed and concrete link roads are padded with an inch-deep layer of dust. Dust particles which get stirred each time a heavy vehicle passes through are a part of the life of people living in the mining 'infested' districts in Bundelkhand area of UP. The nuisance is a clear invitation to silicosis, a major risk factor to tuberculosis (TB). TOI, with the help of The Union fellowship, brings a spot report.
* 'Dust kills us, it is what we breathe and eat': Vimla Devi owns a farm right opposite Badhwa area of Kabrai in Mahoba. She is so sick of dust that she didn't work in a mine or crushing unit despite getting an offer. ""I am happy with my identity as a farmer,"" she says. But the problem of dust is making her think about migration. ""Dust is a huge problem for all of us. It is what we eat and breathe. And we cannot do anything about it. So we are thinking of going to some other place,"" she rues. Not just Vimla, those living in the villages around these crushers are tired of the dust. ""Dust kills most of us. I know of many people who have died coughing because of dust,"" says Uma Shankar, former village pradhan of Dharrara Village - a hamlet of around 3000 people living in a place surrounded by some 40 crusher units. Doctors say that it is natural for people surrounded by so much of dust to cough all the time. This has two implications in context of health. ""People tend to ignore early signs of TB which is prolonged cough for more than three weeks. Secondly, the dust particles which settle in their lungs make their lungs quite weak. The combined effect is that when a villager goes t o see a doctor, there's hardly any time left for intervention,"" said a government doctor.
* The extent of dust and risk: When the stone is crushed, a substantial percentage of the dust emissions are carried away to the surroundings by wind currents. Dust that settles within the plant gets air borne again due to vehicular movement or by wind and acts as a secondary emission source. The circulating dust is a source of environmental, health and safety problems - an aspect of mining which subsequent governments in UP have ignored. The fact stands proven when one gets to know that the last survey undertaken by UP Pollution Control Board to assess the ills of mining took place in 2002. The survey said that the extent of atmospheric air pollution in Bundelkhand was 1800 micrograms per cubic meters against the permissible limit of 200 micrograms per cubic meter. The decade between 2002 and 2012 has seen an increase in the number of lease granted for mining which suggests that the volume of suspended particulate matter must have gone up. And if the extent of illegal mining was also to be considered, then picture would have been grimmer. The Central Pollution Control Board's Comprehensive Industry Series (COIN) document on stone crushers also states that the work place environment at stone crusher sites contain millions of suspended mineral particles of respirable size that get deposited in lungs following inhalation.
* Dust, disease and death: Prof Rajendra Prasad, director, Vallabhbhai Chest Institute, New Delhi, said that atmospheric particulates affect human health either by allowing penetration of the lung and causing irritation to the internal membrane, or by transporting absorbed toxic gases and vapours deeper into the lung than they would normally travel. He also said that those working in mines and stone crushers are highly vulnerable for developing silicosis (lung fibrosis caused by the inhalation of dust containing silica). ""People with silicosis have a 30-fold greater risk for developing TB. Exposure to dust that contains microscopic particles of crystalline silica forms scar tissue in the lungs, which reduces the lungs' ability to extract oxygen from the air. This also compromises a person's immunity and lets the TB bacteria prey on him,"" reveals Dr Ashutosh Dubey, government consultant for chest and lung diseases. ""We have seen how patients in advanced stage of silicosis eventually die of TB, respiratory insufficiency and heart failure,"" says Ashish Sagar, a human rights activist working in Bundelkhand. He adds that lack of safety measures like use of sprinklers while running crushers and providing safety masks and gloves to the workers were rarely followed.
Surveys say it all: Different studies point out how environmental pollution in Bundelkhand was causing health problems for those working and living in the mining pockets. A joint study conducted by Institute of Environment and Development Studies, Bundelkhand University and environmental monitoring division of Indian Institute for Toxicology Research has concluded that 'maximum people (in five districts of Bundelkhand who reported at the Jhansi Medical College) suffered from asthma, pulmonary TB, bronchitis and bronchial asthma'. In Mahoba - where Kabrai is located - pulmonary TB was seen among children too. Another research paper titled ""Tuberculosis among workers exposed to free silica dust"" published in Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reveals that the prevalence of TB was found to be over 10.7% among people working in stone crushers. Those living in and around the crushers are also at risk as crushers barely follow safety norms. ""People exposed to silica at work, or those who have silicosis, have a much greater risk of pulmonary tuberculosis. Silicosis with tuberculosis or silico-tuberculosis is an important cause of death in people exposed to silica for long periods,"" reads the COIN report. It also talks about a survey study carried out in a stone crusher cluster in Trichy district of Tamil Nadu which said that workers in the stone crusher units complained of respiratory problems, eye and skin irritation, diarrhoea and lung ailments, besides general problems like headache, fever, chest pain.
Poverty, malnutrition add to TB risk: It is common knowledge that compromised immunity is an open invitation to diseases. A malnourished individual usually has low resistance to fight with diseases. Unfortunately, Bundelkhand is known for its poverty-stricken people and life. The quality of life may be gauged from the fact that majority of the households use firewood for cooking purposes. This also means that the women are also exposed to household smoke which makes them even more vulnerable to diseases particularly opportunist infection like TB. ""No matter how much governments may deny, but hunger due to poverty and added misery due to loans - both institutional or from money lenders - deprives many families of two meals a day. Education is only a dream for most while status of women is low. The factors combine and manifest as diseases like TB,"" says Arundhati Dhuru, a social activist working for the cause of food security. Madhavi Kuckreja, who also works in Bundelkhand, added that women were the worst affected because of their secondary status. Children too were at risk because of high malnutrition.

Air quality at 'critical' level in the past three days,The Times of India (TOI),1/17/2014,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Over January 14-16, air pollution levels in Delhi reached a level that's linked to ""emergency conditions"" for health. Air quality in Delhi reached a ""critical"" level-i.e. on January 14, 15 and 16 the air was extremely polluted at almost all locations monitored by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research run by the ministry of earth sciences. ""Critical"" air quality impacts everyone, not just the vulnerable.
Both PM10 (coarse particles) and PM2.5 (fine respirable particles) levels rose by about 50%. PM10 levels in Delhi peaked to 875-867 micrograms per cubic metre at Delhi University on December 15-16 and fluctuated between 630 and 670 micrograms per cubic metre on all three days at Mathura Road.
""These levels are extremely high considering the standard is only 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Air quality is likely to be poor on January 17 as well. Pollutants are likely to dissipate after January 19,"" explained chief project scientist, SAFAR, Gufran Beig.
Along with a drop in temperature, the boundary layer (lowest part of atmosphere) was lowered drastically. From a boundary layer of 200m it came down to 60-70m on January 15. On January 16, too, the boundary layer remained at 70m trapping all pollutants.
Beig, however, clarified that such critical pollution levels were not because of emissions from far-off places or neighbouring states. The emissions were from localized sources like transport, burning of biomass or firewood. This is why we saw high PM10 and PM2.5 levels in Dheerpur, Mathura Road, Delhi University and Lodhi Road,"" he said.
""Very poor"" air quality has become a regular feature in Delhi with PM10 levels above 300 micrograms per cubic metre most of the time.

Madras HC cautions govts against 'privatizing' drinking water services,The Times of India (TOI),2/16/2014,INDIA,"CHENNAI: Cautioning governments against privatizing fundamental sovereign responsibilities such as providing drinking water to people, Madras high court has wondered how a company, which dragged Bolivia into international arbitration over privatization of drinking water, was involved in new Tirupur area development scheme.
The state government's ambitious Tirupur development plan envisaged several schemes including treatment and supply of potable water and treatment and disposal of sewage in the city, and it engaged consortium of international companies for the purpose.
While passing orders on disputes over restructuring the stake-holding companies, Justice V Ramasubramanian narrated the dangers of privatising essential constitutional duties such as providing drinking water to people.
He said: ""It is an irony of fate that Bechtel, which was a member of Aguas Del Tunari, the multinational consortium of private investors that was driven out of Bolivia, appears to be part of the consortium selected by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd. for funding New Tirupur Area Development Corporation Ltd. (NTADCL) project. I do not know if anyone is aware of this fact and anyone is aware of what happened in Bolivia.""
In October 1999, Aguas Del Tunari was awarded 40-year concession rights to provide water and sanitation services to the residents of Cochabamba in Bolivia. It was to generate electrical energy and irrigation water for the region's agricultural sector. Following public outcry over 200% increase in water rates, the company was thrown out of Bolivia. In November of 2002, Aguas Del Tunari demanded a minimum compensation of $50 million from the Bolivian government, and dragged it to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a mechanism of the World Bank. Nearly four years later, in January 2006, Aguas Del Tunari agreed to drop their case in ICSID for a token payment from Bolivia, which had by then spent more than one million dollars on legal fees alone.
Noting that there could be no quarrel about the fact that water supply to people was an obligation of the State, Justice Ramasubramanian cited the Supreme Court ruling which said: ""The right to life is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution and it includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life"".
Even internationally, the obligation of the States, especially welfare States, to supply water to its citizens, is well recognised, the judge said, adding: ""Admittedly, no law has been enacted so far (in Tamil Nadu). On the contrary, the enactment that was in force earlier -- Tamil Nadu Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2003 -- has actually been repealed recently.""
The judge said the National Water Policy 2012 suggested that water could be priced to fully recover the cost of operation and administration of water resources projects. Noting that operators in the private sector jumped into the fray to fill up the gap between resources and the unwillingness of the government, Justice Ramasubramanian rued: ""None of the nation-States appears to have drawn a lesson from what had happened in Bolivia and in the neighbourhood of Johannesburg, South Africa, where the policy of privatisation of water supply was tested in recent times.""
The judge said that after water supply was privatised in Johannesburg, people became unable to pay their water bills. ""The private water supply agencies stopped supply of water, forcing residents to drink water from polluted rivers. This led to an outbreak of cholera claiming hundreds of lives and thousands of people getting hospitalized,"" Justice Ramasubramanian explained.

'Pollution pay' for Panasonic's expat staff in China,The Times of India (TOI),3/15/2014,CHINA,"BEIJING: Electronics maker Panasonic Corp has announced it would compensate its Japanese employees for living with heavy smog and pollution in China amid reports that many foreigners were leaving the country due to it.
So-called hardship pay is not unusual for employees of foreign firms sent to work to China. But Panasonic is believed to be the first to announce a premium to compensate for polluted air.
Other firms are expected to emulate the move aimed at retaining staff. A recent European Chamber of Commerce survey showed its members regarded pollution as a major business challenge.
Panasonic said the compensation will be for facing the “PM2.5 problem” referring to tiny particles in the air, which easily penetrate the lungs and have been linked to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths.
It did not disclose the amount of the payments, which start in April and would become part of the annual package negotiated for employees in China. The company clarified the compensation would only be available to members of the Panasonic Union and would not cover local staff. It did not disclose how many staff members would be benefitted.
On the weekend, a top Chinese environment official said that air quality was below national standards in almost all the country’s major cities last year. Only three out of the 74 cities monitored by the government met a new air quality standard, said Wu Xiaoqing, a vice minister of environment protection, underscoring a problem that has set off alarm bells over health concerns. Chinese cities are regularly cloaked in a smoggy haze, with many residents donning masks to avoid taking in the toxic air.

Monthly inspection drive to address residents' woes,The Times of India (TOI),5/22/2014,NOIDA,"NOIDA: Noida Authority and Federation of Noida Residents' Welfare Associations (FONRWA) have decided to carry out a monthly inspection of sectors to and address residents' woes. In its first inspection on Tuesday in Sector 11, RWA members raised issues of traffic jams, broken roads, open sewers lines and noise pollution.
The inspection was carried out by FONRWA president N P Singh, general secretary Rajendra Shukla, chief advisor A N Dhawan, and senior vice president Suresh Tiwari, and K K Jain.
Issues such as car parking by patients/attendees of Metro Hospital in front of residents' gate that led to traffic jams every day, were raised. RWA President, V D Sharma and secretary general Suresh Krishnan also highlighted the increasing levels of air and noise pollution in the area which was causing health problems for residents. The members demanded that a boundary wall be built to prevent movements of anti-social elements in the area, and open sewers between Dwalgiri and Buddha Smarak building be covered up to check the foul smell emanating from it.
FONRWA apprised the Noida Authority of the issues of sectors 11 and 12 on Wednesday. RWA members of sectors 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 22, 27, 23, 50, 52, and 56 were also present in the meeting.
V K Pawar, the Additional Chief Executive Officer (ACEO) assured quick remedies to the problems. ""We will ask Metro hospital to create an underground parking. Roads will be repaired, encroachments will be removed and sewer lines will be cleaned up soon,"" he said.
Deputy Chief Executive Officer, (DCEO) Akhilesh Singh said the problems of dirty water supply and vacant plots will also be taken up. ""We will give the go-ahead for construction work on allotted plots. Those that haven't been allotted will be maintained by the Authority,"" he said.
N P Singh, president, FONRWA said all sectors of Noida will be inspected in the coming days. ""We want work to begin in all sectors. We have asked the ACEO to survey the sectors and assess the problems,"" he said.
Entrepreneurs launch similar drive with Authority
In a similar inspection drive conducted by the Noida Authority and the Noida Entrepreneurs Association (NEA) on Tuesday in industrial sectors 5, 8 and 11, problems of encroachment, broken roads, open and clogged sewer lines, and garbage piles on roads were discussed.

8 new landfill sites identified by DDA,The Times of India (TOI),6/14/2014,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: The lieutenant governor on Monday reviewed the progress in providing land to the corporations to deal with solid waste mess as all the landfills — Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa — are not just polluting and unscientifically built but are now saturated. DDA has identified eight sites.
Another plot of about 60 acres has been identified which, according to DDA, can be shared by the corporations. One of the eight landfills is likely to be in Bawana.
The LG’s high-powered committee on air and water pollution has made recommendations to deal with water scarcity. It has told Delhi Jal Board to list and publicize the sewage treatment plants where treated waste water is available. It added that the water should be supplied to all government agencies like DJB, horticulture departments, DDA, PWD and NDMC. To curb dumping of waste in open drains, the panel has called for boundary walls and laying of a wire mesh along the drains.
It also recommends more dhalaos, so that people don’t dump waste in drains. The panel, however, doesn’t mention anything about waste segregation or recycling. Experts have pointed out that Delhi’s model favours waste disposal but not recycling.

Sushant Lok green belt in grip of parking mafia,The Times of India (TOI),7/24/2014,GURGAON,"GURGAON: The parking mafia has illegally taken over green belt areas on a three-kilometre-long stretch in Gurgaon - from HUDA City Centre metro station to Sushant Lok I - in the garb of parking lots, much to the inconvenience of local residents who blame the authorities for turning a blind eye to the menace.
""Illegal parking has not only blocked passage on the service road, but it has also destroyed trees and small plants in the designated green belt area. When I moved to the colony some 14 years back, it had lush green surroundings. Even when the land was sold, some areas were marked as green belt areas near commercial complexes. Gradually, trees and plants were razed by the parking mafia,"" says Sudha Tiwari, a resident of C Block.
She added: ""Ironically, authorities are promoting 'Raahgiri' on this road only. How can they think of making a cycle path on this road, while keeping their eyes closed to illegal parking.""
Giving details about the encroached area, SP Dawar, General Secretary, Sushant Lok 1 RWA, said: ""The footpath along the entry points from the MG Road to Sushant Lok 1, has been blocked by fixing barred wires, boulders and stones along the road to force private vehicles to use unauthorised parking lots. The condition is same in Block B where a commercial complex and a hospital have encroached upon the green belt and the service road to create a paid parking lot.""
For Shabnam, another resident, air and noise pollution have increased due to encroachment of green belt areas. ""We have been facing serious issue of noise pollution as throughout the day cars are parked in these lots. Apart from the areas that are encroached by commercial complexes, parking mafia has also occupied the green belt,"" she alleges. Another residentsaid, ""When land for commercial complexes was sold, there were about 10 green belt areas on the road. Today, there is none. Pedestrians, especially morning walkers, need to be careful as there are pot holes on the road meant for illegal parking.""
Sources in HUDA told TOI that ""this is a serious issue"". ""All the obstructions should be removed from the green belts area. Besides, green belt areas need to be restored. We will issue notices to defaulters, if any complaint reaches us.""
However, Dawar said: ""We have filed five written complaints to HUDA in the last four years. We have also sent them pictures. Everytime, authorities say that they will look into it. No action has been taken yet.""

Pollution case: NGT issues warrants against 6 Mandideep industrialists,The Times of India (TOI),08-09-2014,POLLUTION,"National Green Tribunal (NGT) central zone bench on Friday issued warrants against six industrialists of Mandideep Industrial Area (MIA) for failure to appear before the tribunal. Industries owned by the six have been accused of pollution and the tribunal is hearing a case with regards to it.
On August 1, tribunal was informed that six industries - M/s Anand Industries, M/s Steel Innovation, M/s Integrated Infosys, Ms/ Shakti Televentures, M/s Tranwin Industries, M/s S S Bindra Flour Mill - were operating without valid consent despite notices.
NGT bench comprising judicial member Justice Dalip Singh and expert member P S Rao had directed the MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) to disconnect electricity and water connections of these six industries.
Notices were issued by NGT to them to appear before tribunal on August 4 to show-cause as to why action should not be initiated against them, failing which warrants of Rs 10,000 each were issued. Next hearing is scheduled for November 10.
Green panel has also directed the state government to inform about installation of continuous monitoring system for monitoring ambient air quality at Mandideep industrial area (MIA).
Green panel has also ordered the state that no lease shall be granted and no further industries shall be allowed to come up in the area until the master plan is finalized after consultation from MoEF and archaeological department seeking air pollution impact of MIA on UNESCO world heritage site Bhimbetka and Bhojpur Temple.
Municipal council, Mandideep and MPAKVN Ltd. have been directed by NGT to carry out extensive plantation drive within their jurisdiction both in municipal limits as well as in industrial area of Mandideep during the current monsoon so as to minimize the effect of pollution.
Municipal Council, Mandideep and MPAKVN Ltd. were directed to carry out extensive plantation within their jurisdiction both in the municipal limits as well as industrial area of Mandideep during monsoon so as to minimize effect of pollution. The plan and steps taken in this behalf so far shall be submitted before the next date.
Also, the bench has ordered principal secretary, housing and environment to issue necessary instructions to all district collectors to review permissions given to industries and also seek opinion of occupants who are residing in such areas within three months.

Ozone layer that started depleting in 1980s healing,The Times of India (TOI),09-11-2014,POLLUTION,"NEW DELHI: The protective ozone layer that started depleting heavily in the 1980's is on a recovery mode according to a new assessment by 300 scientists across the world released on Thursday. ""Assessment for Decision-Makers""-- a summary document of the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2014 published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indicates that the ozone layer is expected to recover to 1980 levels before the middle of this century in many parts.
But the news for India is grim. Tropical countries were not significantly affected by the above ozone depletion problem. But, along with severe climate change impacts, India and other tropical regions may face an ozone depletion problem towards the end of the century. Gufran Beig, project director at System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) of IITM, Pune and only Indian scientist in the international expert review team has flagged off certain ozone concerns for India. Climate change is inducing a change in circulation patterns in the upper layers of the atmosphere that will influence ozone concentration adversely, he has said in his submission.
This undated image provided by NASA shows the ozone layer over the years, Sept. 17, 1979, top left, Oct. 7, 1989, top right, Oct. 9, 2006, lower left, and Oct. 1, 2010, lower right. The fragile ozone layer is finally starting to rebound, says a United Nations panel of scientists. (AP photo)
These changes in the tropical circulation of winds (called Hadley Cell Circulation) will be as a result of climate change and can deplete the ozone layer in future as per the model projections because they tend to shift air in these layers, said Beig. He shared the document he sent to UNEP/WMO with TOI where he adds that concentration of aerosols--suspension of fine liquid droplets in the atmosphere, often particulate air pollution, can negatively impact the ozone layer over the tropics because of their chemical properties. ""It has been the opinion of scientists that increasing greenhouse gas emissions and consequent change in the weather system will impact the ozone layer adversely. There has to be immediate measures to cut down on GHG emissions,"" he added. Beig has also highlighted that emissions from fossil fuel, bio-fuels, industries and power sector, troposphere or ground-level ozone, a toxic gas is increasing in India which also a problem.
Due to successful implementation of the Montreal protocol across the world that mandated phasing out ozone depleting substances such as chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigerators, air conditioners and solvents, the ozone problem has been tackled unto larger extent. But now there is also a problem with the new alternatives. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which are now widely used (replacing CFCs) do not harm the ozone layer but many of them are potent greenhouse gases and have very high global warming potential. Their emissions are growing at a rate of about 7 % per year. Left unabated, they can be expected to contribute very significantly to climate change in the next decades. We have to avoid them"" Beig added., Replacements of the current mix of High GWPs (Global Warming potential) HFCs with alternative compounds with low GWPs would limit this potential problem.
The ozone layer was expected to recover towards its 1980 level by mid-century, or slightly later for Antarctica, where it gets dangerously thin every year between mid-August and November or December.
""The development you saw during the 1990s that the ozone hole got bigger from year to year - that development has stopped, so it has levelled off,"" said Braathen.
""We think in about 2025 or thereabouts we'll be able to say with certainty that the ozone hole is getting smaller,"" he added.
Progress could be sped up by as much as 11 years if existing stocks of ozone-depleting substances - many of them stored up in old fridges and fire-extinguishers - were destroyed.
The largest ozone hole on record was about 30 million square km in 2006. The hole now covers about 20 million square km - big enough for the moon to pass through - but may not have peaked this season.
The size of the hole varies from year to year, partly due to temperature in the upper atmosphere.
The reduction of ozone-damaging chemicals would also help the environment, the report said, as many of the substances were also greenhouses gases blamed for global warming.
But the rising levels of other greenhouses gases in the atmosphere had ""the potential to undermine these gains,"" said the report.
One of the ozone-depleting substances that was supposed to have been phased out - carbon tetrachloride, a solvent - was still being released into the atmosphere suggesting, the report said, illicit production and usage over the past decade.

Dumpyard triggers health alarm in Sec 57,The Times of India (TOI),10-05-2014,GURGAON,"GURGAON: An illegal dumpyard that has sprouted on an encroached land adjacent to a colony of villas in Sector 57 has raised serious health concerns among 100 families living there.
Residents allege that for a year and a half, open incineration of plastic, rubber and other waste by operators of the dumpyard has significantly raised pollution levels in the locality and has begun to affect the health of its residents.
Navya, 16, who has been living in Florence Villas for the last three years, complained of a breathing problem last month. ""When we took her to a doctor, he first asked if we live in a polluted area. She was diagnosed with mild asthma. We live near this dumpyard and air pollution could be the reason behind it,"" said Navya's mother.
Another resident, who moved to Gurgaon from Delhi two years ago, added, ""The dumpyard operated by a scrap dealer has become a health threat for my kids. Burning of solid waste leads to toxic emissions, which sometimes cause eye irritation and headache.""
R K Malhotra, who lives in B1 block, said, ""Every day, scrap is burnt in this area. Solid waste and plastic material are also dumped here and
It has become a breeding ground for pigs. Plus the garbage gemits a foul smell,"" he said.
Residents added they had written to the builder, Ansal Buildwell, and HUDA several times but got no response. ""If the scrap dealer continues to operate in the area, it will be difficult for us to live here,"" another resident of B1 said.
When TOI contacted HUDA, officials said they were on leave and would respond only on the next working day, which is October 7.
Bhuvan Chand Joshi, assistant general manager of Ansal Buildwell, said, ""We are aware of the issue. There are a few unauthorized settlements, including a scrap dealer, in B1 Block. Unfortunately, the area comes under the jurisdiction of HUDA. Despite several written requests, no action has ever been taken by the authorities to remove the settlements.""

'Light up Diwali with diyas not fireworks',The Times of India (TOI),10-06-2014,VARANASI,"VARANASI: The entire city is excited about the Festival of Lights that will be celebrated on Wednesday.
Fire crackers of all sorts have hit the market. They may bring momentary joy to people but will also produce a lot of noise and air pollution. However, officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) seem least bothered and prefer to sleep in blissful ignorance. After a telephonic appointment, TOI went to UPPCB office in Bhelupur on Friday to check facts about the level of noise and air pollution recorded in the city during last year' Diwali. But, regional officer S B Singh's room was locked from inside and his subordinates said he was sleeping and could not be disturbed.
At a time when the officials of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) have put a 'do not disturb' sign outside their office, school children and various private organisations have started creating awareness about the harmful effect of crackers on environment. They are saying no to crackers and aim to light up their Diwali with diyas and not fireworks.
Rachit Awasthi, a Class III student of a private school in Bhagwanpur, has decided to buy less crackers this year. ""My teacher has asked me not to burn many crackers because the smoke from them harms environment. Then we will not be able to breathe properly. So I have asked my mom to bring less crackers this time,"" says Rachit. According to Sneha Agrawal, a student of Class VI, a pledge ceremony organised by her school to say no to crackers influenced her to the extent that she is now telling her family and neighbourhood kids not to burn crackers. Children are going a step ahead in setting rules to celebrate Diwali with sweets and diyas and are telling people about the harm caused by smoke and noise, not only to environment but also to old people, asthma patients, infants and hospitalised patients.
""I was amazed to see my son Sarthak checking noise standards in decibels on the packets of fire crackers when we were shopping for Diwali,"" says Praveen Malhotra, a resident of Mehmoorganj. Several organisations are also carrying out awareness programmes at a number of schools of the city.
According to Alok Chaudhari, a student of geology department of Banaras Hindu University, sound and pollution have become synonymous with Diwali, fading the real meaning of the Festival of Light. ""The campaigns and awareness programmes about air and sound pollution should also be carried out at residential areas, gullies and slums so that common people should know the meaning of silent zones,"" says Alok.
""Even the legal system has set norms for the sounds emitting from fire crackers at residential area with 55 dB at day time and 45 dB at night, most of the people do not know that for an average human being, 40 decibels of sound is the upper limit, however the sounds of the fire crackers is more than 145 decibels,"" says Kuldeep, a student of an engineering college. As per the noise standards for firecrackers notified by the Environment (Protection) Rules, the manufacture, sale or use of firecrackers generating noise level exceeding 125-145 dB shall be prohibited.

TOI manifesto for Mumbai,The Times of India (TOI),11-01-2014,MUMBAI,"Mapping the way forward for the new government
Mumbai has been in a state of decline for over two decades despite being the country's financial nerve centre. The once genteel, cosmopolitan city has to contend with crumbling infrastructure, increasing social and class tension, and a widening gap between the ultra-rich and the poor. Its civic administration is the country's largest, with an annual budget (of over Rs 30,000 crore) that's bigger than Kerala's.
The city is home to 28 billionaires with combined assets worth $97 billion (Wealth X and UBS Billionaire Census 2014), but over half its 12 million people live in appalling conditions in shanties. Luxury skyscrapers and glass-fa\xE7ade offices tower over slum sprawls.
This decay is because of poor civic governance, unbridled corruption, and builder-driven policies. Roads are in a mess, pavements either broken or non-existent, ratio of open spaces per 1,000 people among the lowest in the world (less than 0.03 acre per 1,000 people). Public land is deliberately parceled off to the land mafia with political connections.
Severe land shortage land makes Mumbai's real estate one of the most expensive in the world. The Economic Digest of the Maharashtra Economic Development Council says about 96% of Mumbaikars live in inadequate shelters -- 6 million in slums, 2.5 million in rundown buildings, 1.5 million in government staff quarters and 1.5 million in matchbox Mhada tenements.
Despite its numerous problems, Mumbai's preeminence as the country's economic powerhouse remains unchallenged despite the rise of Gurgaon and Bangalore. Many of the country's largest business houses and MNCs are headquartered here. The city generates 6.16% of the country's GDP, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of custom duty collections, 20% of central excise collections, and 40% of India's foreign trade. The BJP government's priority now should be to clean up corruption as far as possible, crank up infrastructure, overhaul civic administration, and create the conditions to make Mumbai a first world city.
Affordable housing, slum-free development
For people, not builders
Building and slum redevelopment schemes should be made people-oriented, not builder-driven. Mumbai's real estate is among the costliest in the world and housing a distant dream for a majority of its 12 million-plus people. The cheapest fl at could cost around a crore rupees. Over 6 million people live in slums. Roughly 2.5 million in dilapidated buildings, around a million live in government or municipal quarters and another million in Mhada fl ats. The government may need to take charge of public housing instead of allowing private developers a free run. In 1996, the then Shiv Sena-BJP government promised to provide free houses to 40 lakh slum dwellers, but two decades later, the scheme has been abused by builders, politicians and local goons to make a fast buck. Under the cross-subsidy scheme, builders rehoused slum residents free of cost in new buildings on a small portion of the land and then utilised the larger portion to build luxury towers for sale in the open market to make super profi ts. In the name of housing the poor, the scheme has been abused by builders, politicians and local goons to make a fast buck. In 20 years, the slum authority has built about 1.50 lakh houses, another 1 lakh are in the pipeline. Ideally, it should have aimed at building at least 3 lakh houses a year to make Mumbai virtually slum-free in fi ve years. Housing activists say the scheme resulted in the eviction of more than 50% of slum dwellers and also made them suffer in newly constructed rehab buildings where infrastructure is inadequate and construction shabby. This scheme, which has failed to deliver results, needs a relook.
Open space
Save playgrounds from land sharks
Public land earmarked for recreational activities but encroached by slums and structures must be reclaimed immediately. Regenerate and protect mangroves, creeks, beaches. Playgrounds should be used only for sporting activities, nothing else. A comprehensive open-space policy must be framed on a war-footing because living conditions for most Mumbaikars have deteriorated in terms of light, air and a healthy environment. Shoddy planning, haphazard construction and unabated encroachment of public spaces have robbed citizens of a decent quality of life. BMC statistics show that in the island city, on an average, more than 45,000 people are cramped into every sq km, while Singapore (population 5 million) has a ratio of 7,300 people per sq km. Mumbai, a city of 12.4 million, has just seven public swimming pools. The city has less than 0.03 acre of open space for every 1,000 people (international norm is 4 acres for 1,000 people). London has 12 acres, Singapore 6 acres and New York has about 4 acres per 1,000 people. Ever since, as the population increased, large swathes of land reserved for public amenities either got encroached by slums or de-reserved for construction. Mumbai's mangroves, playgrounds, parks, waterfronts and protected forest land got built upon. This must stop.
Public health
Get funds, manage better
The WHO recommends 1 bed per 550 people but the Maximum City has 1 per 3,000. Worse, these are unequally distributed: the most affordable beds (12,000 in BMC and 8,000-plus in state hospitals) are in south Mumbai, the posher part of the city. The bustling suburbs have a rickety health infrastructure. The private sector offers 20,000 beds, and these aren't concentrated in the cash-rich south. On paper, BMC's health infrastructure for Mumbai's 12 million-plus people is reasonable: 162 dispensaries, four superspecialty hospitals in south Mumbai and 16 smaller hospitals in the suburbs. But it's crippled by a shocking lack of manpower-some of its hospitals have up to 50% doctors' positions vacant. More funds are needed to upgrade this system and retain talent. The BMC's health budget is impressive at Rs 2,508 crore for 2013-14, but it's only 9% of the total expenditure. Contrast this with 30 years ago when the BMC reserved over 25% of its budget for health. As health encompasses sanitation, garbage disposal and drainage system as well as open space and town planning, there is a greater need now than ever before to incorporate health planning into every aspect of civic planning. Only then can age-old ailments such as malaria, dengue and cholera be wiped out. Mumbai has the infrastructure that can -with better planning and financial management- be an excellent prototype for the Universal Healthcare Access that the Centre is struggling is start. The political will has so far been missing.

The BEST transport service with 4,200 buses, which ferries 40 lakh commuters daily, has deteriorated. The popular air-conditioned fl eet is hobbled with frequent breakdowns and at least 100 buses are in poor shape. The new government must quickly release funds for new AC buses and help the cash-strapped BEST replace its existing 282 AC Cerita buses which frequently broke down, with AC buses of better quality. It should introduce more routes on the north-south corridor over express highways and the Eastern Freeway. Improved services will dissuade offi ce goers from using cars. There's been a 55% increase in the number of vehicles on roads, which includes a 57% rise in the number of private cars, over eight years. In comparison, the BEST fl eet has grown only 23%. The ratio of private cars to public transport is an alarming 90 to 10. The wait for 400 red buses from the Centre has been inordinately long. New buses with better seating (no bucket seats, please), leg space and effi cient suspension are sorely needed. The suburban railway service, which transports 7.5 million commuters a day, requires augmentation. The new government should speed up the CST-Panvel and Churchgate-Virar high-speed corridor, which was put on the back burner by the previous Democratic Front government.
Environment and pollution
Focus on clean air & pavements
The Mumbai air is heavy with carbon dioxide, high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The reparable suspended particulate matter too is above permissible limits. In October, both the NO and NO2 levels in the city crossed 252 micrograms/cubic metre against a standard of 80. RSPM went up to 170 microgram/cubic metre, while the permissible limit is only 100. All of this can be highly damaging for the lungs. Rising pollution has resulted in people suffering respiratory problems and the city's fl ora and fauna suffering serious damage. The new government must focus on giving citizens clean air to breathe. It must fi nd a way to cut vehicular density on city streets. Instead of concentrating entirely on building highways and a sea-link, it must improve pavements so that people are encouraged to walk short distances. It should invest in making public transport better, ensuring fewer private cars on the roads. Cycling lanes should be built to make it safe for bikers.
Utilise natural assets
Save saltpans to stop flooding
This city has rivers, mangroves, beaches, saltpans, lakes and a 103 sq km national park on its fringes, but they are under constant threat. Priority must be given to protecting these prize natural assets for they're being encroached upon by slums, residential towers and commercial spaces. The construction industry has been lobbying to throw open 5,000 acres of eco-sensitive saltpans for development, which could prove suicidal for the city. Saltpans act as natural sponge and absorb excess rainwater preventing the kind of fl ooding that drowned Mumbai a decade ago. The state government must protect these to secure the city from natural calamities. Restoring beaches is the need of the hour. For, they're drowning in fi lth and are being nibbled away. The mindless destruction of mangroves, abuse of rivers and creeks as sewage channels have caused serious damage to the environment. Successive governments have, by and large, ignored these issues. The new dispensation can't afford to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors.
For a safer Mumbai
Upgrade technology
Street crimes like chain-snatchings, sexual abuse and crime against women and children are on the rise. The city has witnessed a spike ranging between 12% and 39% in cases of crimes against women since last year. In the first nine months of this year 473 rape cases were reported - a 39% rise. Cases fi led for outraging a woman's modesty rose by 32% compared to last year, while kidnapping of women and girls went by 12%. Over 1,000 incidents of chain-snatching were reported between January and September, but police said the number has slightly dropped since last year. Other law-and-order problems included communal tension in some slums. The government should implement the longpending CCTV project, for it'll help check street crimes. The city force has 93 police stations and 42,500 personnel for a population of over 12 million; this is just about adequate, compared to other cities like New York, which has around 35,000 cops for 8.4 million people. A police station here has 200 staff and all can't be put on patrolling duty. Merely increasing staff strength won't help. Technology needs to be upgraded.
School education
For better learning & fewer dropouts
Improve quality of learning at civic schools. BMC school students declined to 4.34 lakh in 2013 from 4.51 lakh in 2008 with more parents opting for private schools despite the high fees. State board school students are migrating to central and international boards. In recent years, the number of CBSE, ICSE and IGCSE schools in the city has shot up. For instance, Mumbai houses over 80 of the country's 300 IGCSE schools. Another problem is the 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009. Schools have turned away children seeking admission under this quota as the institutions are not reimbursed for the pre-primary years. About 80% of city schools have secured the minority tag to seek exemption from these quotas. Of the total state budget allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for school education, about 90% goes in salaries for teachers and non-teaching staff, 5% on midday meals. Focus should now be on learning and implementation of the child policy. Extending RTE's ambit to Class X will help curb dropout rates.
Higher education
Give univs tech edge, teachers better pay
The new government needs to immediately implement some positives from the Kakodkar Committee report to help larger universities such as Mumbai. Growth in the number of affi liated colleges has led to a collapse of the admin-istration. Conducting exams for these colleges has been difficult, with Mumbai University committing goof-ups almost every other day in recent times. The university has been trying to introduce technology to make the exam process smooth, but more funds are needed to fool-proof the process. The state allocates Rs 400 crore for expenditure on public universities, of which over 80% goes in salary grants. Still, over 75% faculty posts in professional colleges affi liated to Mumbai University aren't government-approved. The state should increase allocation in higher education and hasten the process of approving posts of teaching and non-teaching staff. The demand for self-fi nanced courses over traditional ones is on the rise in Mumbai, and the government should either regulate them or give them autonomy. To deal with faculty crunch, the government can invest in virtual universities.
Pothole-free roads
Clean up the tendering process
A city aspiring to be a leading global financial centre has some of the most appalling, crater-filled roads despite thousands of crores spent on improving them. This year alone, BMC allotted Rs 2,000 crore for repair and upkeep of roads. Yet, the maximum number of potholes at any given time was pegged at over 14,450 for a total road length of 1,941 km. A cartel of road contractors, hand-in-glove with unscrupulous civic offi cials, controls tendering. Year after year, they bag lucrative contracts even though some of them are blacklisted for shoddy work (they often return under a different guise). Contractors quote ridiculously low rates and cut corners using substandard material. Municipal road engineers certify these roads and approve bills of these contractors for a cut. The need is for a transparent system that will allow reputed construction and infrastructure fi rms to participate in road building. Ensure strict supervision of work.

"North India's cities the most polluted, south's cleanest",The Times of India (TOI),12/28/2014,POLLUTION,"NEW DELHI: Almost all of the most polluted cities in India are located in the north with Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan dominating the list, according to a WHO report on the most polluted cities in the world published earlier this year.
Incidentally, UP, Punjab and Delhi also lie in the fog belt of northern India and there's evidence to show that air pollution is worsening the problem. Early last year, TOI had reported on a study which found that average fog hours in the month of January in Delhi had increased by as much as eight hours since 1989 - a trend attributed to rising pollution.
When the WHO report came out in May, much was made out of the fact that Indian cities dominated the list, with Delhi earning the dubious tag of the most polluted city in the world. But not as much attention was paid to which were the most polluted among Indian cities.
Of the worst 30 cities, UP laid claim to nine, Punjab to five and Rajasthan to four. Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra had three cities each while J&K, Bihar and Uttarakhand had one each. Raipur in Chhattisgarh, Ahmedabad in Gujarat and Delhi rounded out the list. In all, 124 Indian data stations - mostly in cities - were featured in the WHO report.
Meanwhile, the 5 cities with the cleanest air were all located in south India. Two were in Kerala - Kollam and Pathanamthitta, one in Karnataka - Hassan, one in Tamil Nadu - Madurai, and Pondicherry.
The WHO used the concentration of particles in the air under 2.5 microns to determine how bad air pollution is. Such particles cause the most damage to health because when inhaled, they can penetrate deep into the lungs, whereas larger particles are generally filtered out before they reach that far. Pathanamthitta, the cleanest city on the list, recorded a concentration of 10 parts per million of particles under 2.5 microns. Compare that to Delhi, which has a concentration of 153 parts per million of such particles - more than fifteen times that of Pathanamthitta.
Dr Gufran Beig, the director and chief scientist of System Air quality Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said that this is because many cities in the north are located on the Indo-Gangetic plains region, which stretches from Kolkata through Delhi into Pakistan.
""In addition to local sources of pollution, Indo-Gangetic cities also get pollution from neighboring regions and other parts of India, so as a result the pollution level becomes very high,"" Beig said.
Because of the location of the Indo-Gangetic plains at the foothills of the Himalayas, climate conditions are such that air masses often converge in the plains, both in the summer and the winter.
""During the summer, winds sweep towards the Indo-Gangetic plains through south India and from the north through the Himalayas, converging in the plains,"" Dr. Beig said. ""This means the polluted air from south and central India and from the north and Nepal all converge in the plains.""
Meanwhile, during the winter, winds from the northeast and the west come in and temperatures drop, causing the air over the Indo-Gangetic plains to become very calm.
""This creates a stagnant condition,"" Beig said. ""The boundary layer which separates the ground atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, comes much closer to the ground because of the cooler temperatures. That makes it much harder for pollution to disperse.""
On the other hand, south and central Indian cities have more normal weather conditions, according to Beig, making pollution less of a problem there.
In addition to climate conditions, there are more sources of pollution in the north that makes the air quality worse, according to Sarath Guttikunda, a emissions researcher and director of UrbanEmissions.info.
""In north India the winters are harsh, so most people have to burn things to keep warm. More garbage is being burned in the North,"" Guttikunda said. ""Also, there are a large number of brick kilns in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Though you have them in the south as well, they are different in structure and technology - in the north they are coal-based.""
Thus, despite the south's reputation as a hub of manufacturing, such as Chennai's automobile industry, because of climate conditions and fewer sources of pollution south India tend to suffer less from bad air quality than north India. Kerala, which is both on the coast and has little industrial activity, with an economy dominated by service activities such as tourism and remittances, has many of the least polluted cities in the country.

Britain's ethnic minorities breathing most polluted air,The Times of India (TOI),1/27/2015,POLLUTION,"LONDON: Britain's ethnic minorities are breathing the most polluted air.
A first of its kind scientific analysis has found a big difference in air pollution across communities in England, with deprived and ethnic minority areas the worst affected.
Air pollution levels are linked to many forms of ill health, including higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially for more vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly.
Researchers at Imperial College London and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands examined data on two types of air pollution: particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). They compared air pollution exposures for small areas in England and the Netherlands with population characteristics including deprivation, ethnic makeup, and proportions of children and elderly people.
The EU Ambient Air Quality Directive set limits of 40 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3) at monitoring stations for both PM10 and NO2 pollution. Concentration averages across all neighbourhoods in England and all but two neighbourhoods in the Netherlands were within this limit for PM10, but 11% of neighbourhoods in England and nine per cent in the Netherlands exceeded the NO2 limit, accounting for an affected population of 5.4 million and 2.7 million respectively.
In England, the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods had higher air pollution levels than the least deprived neighbourhoods - 1.5 \xB5g/m3 higher PM10 and 4.4 \xB5g/m3 NO2 after adjusting for other factors - but this was not the case in the Netherlands. The biggest differences in air pollution levels according to socioeconomic status were in London.
The worst air pollution levels were seen in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, defined as those where more than 20% of the population are non-white. Even after allowing for the fact that some of these neighbourhoods are more deprived, in England, this difference was 3.0 \xB5g/m3 for PM10 and 10.1 \xB5g/m3 for NO2. In the Netherlands, differences were lower, with 1.1 \xB5g/m3 higher PM10 and 4.5 \xB5g/m3 NO2.
Lead researcher Dr Daniela Fecht from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said ""The study highlights the fact that inequalities in exposure to air pollution are mainly an urban problem, suggesting that measures to reduce environmental air pollution inequality should focus on cutting vehicle emissions in deprived urban neighbourhoods"".
The reasons for the associations between ethnic minorities and air pollution are unclear. ""England and the Netherlands have a long history of immigration. It's possible that immigrants settled in particular areas may tolerate poorer air quality for the benefits of living close to friends and family, even when their communities become less deprived,"" said Dr Fecht.

'Green tax' on vehicles older than 15 yrs,The Times of India (TOI),02-01-2015,KANPUR,"Regional Transport Office (RTO) in the city has started collection of 'green tax' from the vehicles that are 15-year-old. A total one-time tax of 10% of the tax that was paid at the time of first registration will be charged at the time of re-registration of the two or four-wheeler after it crosses its valid limit of 15 years.
Green tax or environmental tax is a tax imposed on environmental pollutants or on goods whose repeated use contributes to pollution.
The state government has decided to impose the tax to limit the number of old vehicles in the city, thereby curbing air pollution. The current emission standard of vehicles is 'Bharat 4', which produce considerably low smoke. The RTO officials suggest that implementation of the new tax will limit the smoke emitting vehicles in the city. ""Green Taxes are one of a variety of policy measures formulated by the government to control activities which affect the environment. The purpose of these environmental taxes is to reduce the extent of use of old vehicles that are not upgraded as per the new standards of pollutions.
It is believed that because of fear of paying 10% tax on every re-registration, people would opt to discard their old vehicles. This besides curbing increasing pollution in the city will also limit the number of vehicles,"" said ARTO, SK Singh.
""A total of 10% of the one-time tax that was paid at the time of the first registration will be charged during the re-registration. This means that if a person had paid Rs. 50,000 at the time of first registration, he will have to pay Rs. 5000 as 'green tax' after 15 years. It will be imposed on two-wheelers and four-wheelers bought in the year 2000,"" he added.
Till now for re-registering a two-wheeler, the owner was charged with a nominal fee of Rs. 30, while four-wheelers had to pay Rs. 200. But, from now onwards, they will have to pay 10% 'green tax'. According to the RTO officials, the state government would be using the 'green fund' for upgrading the infrastructure of the state. They said that since their online registration system is not upgraded according to the new norms, the re-registration work will be done manually in the RTO offices situated in Sarvodaya Nagar.

"Delhi's waste-to-energy plants 'toxic, costly, inefficient'",The Times of India (TOI),3/31/2015,POLLUTION,"NEW DELHI: Waste-to-energy incineration plants may not help Delhi deal with its massive trash problem. They may instead end up adding to its air pollution and cost the government a substantial sum.
When two such plants in Narela and Ghazipur are about to start operations, experts at a conference organized by Toxics Link, an environmental NGO, said incineration plants are expensive, yet unviable. There is a consensus that mixed trash is unsuitable for incineration, as it's not only polluting but extremely inefficient due to its low calorific value.
Shyamala Mani, professor at National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), that assists the ministry of urban development in formulating policies, highlighted concerns with the quality of waste in cities. She quoted a recent study by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that measured the emissions from a landfill site called Dhapa near Kolkata and found very high levels of non-methane volatile organic compounds including several carcinogens. Since the composition of waste in cities is similar, the findings apply to Delhi's poorly managed landfill sites and mixed waste as well. The study concluded that the cumulative cancer risk was found to be 2,792 per million population. Workers at landfill sites are at major risk.
NIUA has made formal representations to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change and CPCB requesting a policy to be drafted for handling of hazardous waste from homes and small industries. ""Mercury in Indian waste is 10 to 15 times the prescribed standard. Unless MoEFCC supports us with a detailed description of how these can be handled, we are skeptical,"" she said referring to plans for more waste-to-energy plants. She also highlighted that the calorific value of mixed waste is about 50% lower than what's required for incineration. This leads to less energy being generated. Pollution control measures for these plants are also expensive.
There was intense debate about the waste-to-energy plant in Okhla over the same concerns. Residents from the area alleged that plastics and other hazardous waste are routinely incinerated by the plant putting their very lives at risk. Dieter Mutz, director of GIZ, too, said that the plant had been incinerating all kinds of waste including valuable reusable material in construction and demolition waste. Speakers also highlighted that the technology is very costly, the Okhla plant cost about Rs 200 crore and was developed in a public-private partnership model.
Saurabh Khatri of Delhi Dialogues Commission, a thinktank under the new AAP government, asked experts if segregating waste in Delhi can help address the problem. DDC is likely to hold a stakeholders' meet with civil society organizations and waste workers on waste-to-energy early next month.
Industry bodies, however, tried to justify incineration. ""Incineration can be done in a small space whereas biomethanation requires a huge amount of space that Delhi doesn't have. Now it's up to the government,"" said Gyan Misra of IL & FS, that's setting up plants in Ghazipur and Timarpur. CPCB scientist Vinod Babu, too, claimed that the issue of dioxin release in Okhla plant has been addressed and the plant is functioning properly.

'Suspended matter weighs heavy on lungs',The Times of India (TOI),4/13/2015,LUCKNOW,"LUCKNOW: Lungs are more to pollution now because of nano-pollutants called PM1 in city's air. Chest experts, who gathered in the city for a sector update meeting on Sunday, predict increase of about 10% in asthma, chronic bronchitis and COPD cases due to the pollutant in next 2-3 years.
PM1 is the smallest of finely divided solids or liquids that rise from combustion, industrial activities or natural sources and remain suspended in the air. They are so small they are not even pulled down by gravitational force and acquire a 'repairable' character. All kinds of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) threatens to pulmonary health.
""Nano particle (PM1) can complicate things, said host of the programme pulmonary expert Dr B P Singh. ""Though no study has been conducted in the context of Lucknow, PM1 can add to the burden of COPD, bronchitis besides being an important cause of lung cancer,"" he added.
SPM are inhaled through the nasal airway and get trapped in the nose and upper respiratory track. While particles of the size 2.5 to 10 units percolate till the trachea, the ones sizing between 1.5 and 2.5 unit trickle down till the lower airways and lungs. PM1 goes to the deepest parts of the lung.
Dr Sujeet Rajan, Bombay Hospital Institute of Medical Sciences said PM1 makes matters worse for existing patients of COPD and asthma. ""They irritate the airways and provoke an intense inflamatory reaction which causes swelling in parts of lung besides increasing production of mucus causing congestion, wheezing and breathlessness. Complications aggravate with the presence of co-morbidities like cardiovascular diseases,"" he said.
The size of RSPM in city's air is reducing constantly. Experts at Indian Institute of Toxicology Research have noted the presence of this particle which ranges between 0.3-1 micro meter. The agency has in fact started monitoring the presence of PM1 in city's air.
Vehicular pollution was the main contributor of RSPM in Lucknow. About 9% vehicles are added on city roads every year, according to Regional Transport Office statistics. In 2014, number of private vehicles swelled by 146.9% including 37% cars.

Ghaziabad air pollution 4 times over normal,The Times of India (TOI),04-10-2015,NOIDA,"GHAZIABAD: The analysis of Ghaziabad's air samples, collected by the state pollution control board, has come to alarming conclusions. Levels of suspended particulate matter in the city's air have been three-four times higher than normal in the past five months.
The samples were collected by the board's regional office in Vasundhara Sector 16.
The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board has, however, claimed that the city has recorded a decrease in pollutants - ultrafine particles of size less than 10 microns (PM 10) and 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) - in the past two months, particularly in the February and March, due to wet weather conditions.
""Decrease in pollutants, particularly those of ultrafine particulate matter, in the past two months could be attributed to wet weather conditions. High moisture content in the air helps settle air particles quickly. But these figures are not reflective of any long-term decreasing trend in pollution levels in Ghaziabad. We have begun monitoring PM 2.5 levels only recently. It's still unclear as to what quantum of pollutants is contributed by cities in the NCR. A source apportionment study needs to be conducted by the CPCB to determine the contribution of pollutants by the NCR cities,"" said a senior UPPCB official.
According to the state pollution board officials, 24-hour ambient air quality monitoring tests conducted on the borders of Ghaziabad and Delhi on the directions of the National Green Tribunal have been inconclusive. The tests were conducted on February 16, 17 and 18 by the regional pollution control board at the Apsara Border near Dilshad Garden and on NH-24 near UP Gate in February.
The average of PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels at Apsara Border were 148.49 and 105.37 micrograms per cubic metre respectively on February 16-17. The corresponding figures for these parameters on the same dates on NH-24 were 155.10 and 114.13 micrograms per cubic metre respectively. The average levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 at Apsara Border were 161.31 and 119. 86 micrograms per cubic metre respectively on February 17-18. Averages of these pollutants on the same day on NH-24 were 158.47 and 110.02 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.

86% 'bad air' days in Delhi this winter,The Times of India (TOI),04-06-2015,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Delhiites could be inhaling a cocktail of toxins all through winter, with 'good air' days few and far between. A data analysis reveals that air quality in the capital this winter was poor or worse on 86% of days, showing deterioration over the previous two years.
The three-year analysis of air quality during October to February showed that 'good air' days - when the AQI is either good or moderate - had also declined from 19% and 22% in the previous two years to 14% in 2014-15.
The analysis was conducted by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). It found that AQI in 76% of the winter days in 2014-15 was in the 'poor' category compared to 67% and 54% in the preceding years.
Only relief this winter came in the form of a dip in the number of severely polluted days, which fell to 3% from 16% (in 2012-13) to 6% (2013-14). Severely polluted days, when the AQI is 250 or higher, are often determined by weather conditions.
The figures are based on data from 10 monitoring stations in NCR. If the same levels occurred in the US, the 'poor' days would be considered 'very unhealthy'. Similarly, the 7% of days when Delhi air was in the 'very poor' category would have triggered 'health warnings of emergency conditions' under the US index.
""We found that 2014 has been unusually bad. What is worrying is the data indicates that the annual average didn't change much but the frequency of 'poor' days increased significantly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune.
Neighbouring Noida's air quality this winter seems to have been even worse. It recorded 33% 'severe' days and 46% 'poor' days, compared to 7% severe and 58% poor days in 2013-14.
SAFAR has categorized each day's PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) level under five heads: good, moderate, poor, very poor and severe as per the air quality index (AQI). The concentration range of PM2.5 in the 'poor' category is 90-210 micrograms per cubic metre while the safe standard is 60.
This week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch AQI for 10 cities, including Delhi, under Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). An hourly AQI will available on the ministry's website.
So many poor-air-quality days usually call for health precautions such as minimizing physical and outdoor activities of vulnerable people such as the old and those with cardiac or respiratory conditions. But in the absence of a health advisory for air pollution in India, many may not even have known about the bad quality.
""Those with heart disease, COPD, asthma or allergies suffer a lot during poor-air-quality days. Those with heart disease can even collapse. Use of drugs increases, which has its own side effects,"" said Dr T K Joshi, director, Centre for Environment Occupational and Health (CEOH).
Recently, Joshi has recommended to the Delhi government that a health advisory be issued and a special prevention strategy be prepared for schools. ""The class teacher should monitor PM10 (coarse pollutants) and PM2.5 regularly. Children's physical activity should be restricted if there is severe or very-poor air quality,"" he suggested.

International boost to Shimla world heritage tag hope,The Times of India (TOI),5/16/2015,CHANDIGARH,"SHIMLA: After decades of mindless development and environment-destroying activities, both by the successive governments and residents of Shimla, there is finally a hope of change for the hilly town. The lure of getting the Unesco World Heritage Site tag has set the ball rolling with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) coordinating internationally to set the things right.
Shimla's deputy mayor Tikender Singh Panwar said that international tie-ups would play an important role in the city's bid to get the global heritage status. ""Various socio-cultural, economic and geographical aspects between Chhota Shimla to Indian Institute of Advance Studies stretch are one of its kind in the whole world and need to be recognized as such. We are initiating the measures with the help of international agencies not only to seek the world heritage tag but also to be able to learn and share at international stage,"" he added.
The US government's Agency for International Development has selected three cities from across the world as resource cities for development - Townsville at Australia, Summerville at Massachusetts and Shimla (only city in entire South Asia). There are three corresponding partner cities - Portmore in Jamaica, La ceiba in Honduras and Boulder City in Colorado, respectively.
Colorado Boulder City's International City/ Country Management Association (ICCMA) team - Carl Castillo and Josephine Lee, arrived in Shimla on May 10 and met SMC officials, various NGO's and stakeholders from various departments. ""The city of Shimla was chosen to be resource partner with Boulder City as these two have so many things in common. Boulder has water scarcity same as Shimla, it is also a mountainous region situated at height of 5,400 feet just as Shimla is at 7,234 feet and we have same progressive government,"" said adviser Carl Castillo.
He said that Shimla has kind people, rich culture, cooperative government and amazing landscape but all of this needs to be sustained. ""Climatic changes are affecting the urban system which includes health, transportation, constructions and other things. We are here to identify and assess the problems in Shimla. Some of them are related to construction, excessive tree cutting, slum mushrooming, excessive use of vehicles causing air pollution, and water pollution. City has to preserve its natural and built heritage which can be sustained for years. We have to do capacity-building of SMC in terms of knowledge of resources and other aspects,"" he added.
Program manager Josephine Lee said that they planned to visit Shimla again in January 2016 with more members. ""Starting from May 11, in one week, we tried to touch around every tangible aspects of this city and checked its water supply management, sewerage system, supply chain management of city, solid waste management, transportation system, and parking system. For that purpose, we visited Ashwani Khadd water source, Dhali, Baghira and Bhariyal, Krishnanagar slum area and Lower Bazaar,"" she said.
She said that on the basis of the research, they were preparing the objectives and a relevant plan. There is strong need to strengthen the beauty of this city and its wildlife, she added.
Nainital's Kumaun University Professor P C Tiwari from Urban Climate Change Research Management Centre also arrived Shimla. He said that as ecology of this city was quite fragile, there was need to create awareness among the civic bodies and its people to preserve it.

Green body to track gas emissions online,The Times of India (TOI),07-02-2015,INDIA,"NEW DELHI: Taking a significant step forward to deal with pollution by monitoring effluents and emissions from polluting industries, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has started getting round the clock online data eport on status of compliance from 1,320 out of 2,800 such industrial units from across the country.
While 920 of these 1,320 units have set up real-time sensor-based sophisticated monitoring devices, another 400 units have moved towards 'Zero Liquid Discharge' (ZLD) system where they treat the entire water and re-use it. Such units will not discharge a drop of waste water into drains or rivers.
The remaining industries will come on board by September. Though there was a deadline of June 30 for all industries to install sensor-based monitoring devices at their ends, certain industries like petro-chemicals, oil refineries and power plants will get it done during their phase-wise scheduled shut-down period in next three months.
""This is a big leap in the management of pollution in the country"", said Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar while announcing the launch of the 24X7 real-time monitoring system here on Tuesday.
He said, ""Polluting industries will be dealt with strictly. We will not spare any unit which is found to be dischargingemitting pollutants beyond prescribed limits"".
The environment ministry has also made it mandatory for new distillery, textile, tannery, chemicals, fertilizer, pesticides, dyes and pharmaceutical unit to go for ZLD system before getting final order for commissioning. It will also be compulsory for other highly polluting units to install the real-time monitoring device to constantly check the status of effluents and emissions.
The ministry will in due course bring necessary amendments in the existing laws, incorporating the functioning of the tech-based monitoring system. Since the existing rules are not very strict for the units that violate anti-pollution laws, the government will also bring amendments in laws on air and water pollution so that stricter clauses of penalties or heavy fines can be imposed on industries which flout the rules.
""Amendments to incorporate civil penalty is required as closing down units are not always a desirable option, keeping in mind the employment of people or supply of essential items"", explained an official. Sixty-four units were closed down last year. Out of them, 60 units have now complied and installed 24/7 monitoring system.
The high-tech device will not only end human intervention that was marred by instances of corruption in the past but also make the monitoring a round-the-clock process under the central pollution watchdog. Under the system, government will send SMS alert to those industries whose pollutant parameters are found to be exceeding the prescribed limits for more than 15 minutes at a stretch.
""A pilot phase for sending an SMS alert to polluting units that cross prescribed levels for more than 15 minutes has been started. State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) have also been asked to gear up to handle sets of data that will be required to be analyzed on a real-time basis"", said Javadekar while demonstrating the functioning of the online monitoring system.
He said his ministry was making necessary arrangements for handling large data sets which shall be required to be analyzed on real-time basis once all the 2,800 units install the sophisticated devices or go for ZLD system.
The units, opting for ZLD mode, have installed cameras instead of continuous effluent monitoring devices. The pictures from those cameras will also be reflected back to the system at the central monitoring station of the CPCB.

A parliamentary panel asks government not to rush with changes in existing green laws,The Times of India (TOI),7/26/2015,DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES,"NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns of civil societies, NGOs and experts, a parliamentary panel has asked the government not to rush through the proposals of a high-level committee to bring amendments in six existing green laws, saying it would result in ""unacceptable dilution"" of the present environment protection architecture.
Considering views of over 50 organizationsindividualsexperts from across the country, the panel - Parliamentary Standing Committee on environment and forests - has recommended that the government should, rather, give due consideration to the views expressed by stakeholders before proceeding with the suggestions of the high-level committee (HLC) that had submitted its report to the Center in November last year.
The HLC, headed by former cabinet secretary TSR Subramanian, had come out with 55 recommendations while suggesting changes in the existing laws. It was set up by the government in August, 2014 to get suggestions to bring changes in green laws to make it sync with the Center's economic growth agenda without damaging the environment.
The HLC had reviewed Environment Protection Act (1986), Forest Conservation Act (1980), Wildlife Protection Act (1972), Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1974), Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and Indian Forest Act (1927). Its recommendations include making a new 'umbrella law' (Environment Laws Management Act) to enable creation of new institutions at both the Center and state levels as processing, clearance and monitoring agencies.
It also suggested revised project approval process envisaging 'single-window' unified, streamlined, purposeful and time-bound procedures for green clearances for many projects. It, at the same time, sought special treatment for linear (road, rail and transmission lines), powermining and strategic border projects.
Though the government was still in the process of examining those recommendations through inter-ministerial consultations, environmentalists and experts had come out with their pointed objections while making submission before the parliamentary panel.
The panel, headed by Congress Rajya Sabha MP Ashwani Kumar, had submitted its report to the Parliament during the ongoing Monsoon session. It noted that the civil societies and experts raised strong objection even to the composition of the HLC, highlighting that none of its members had any expertise in the field of environment and wildlife.
The panel, comprising MPs from all major political parties including BJP, has recommended formation of a new committee to consider afresh specific areas of environmental policy.
Welcoming the panel's recommendation of setting up another committee to review the HLC's suggestions, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said it has already expressed its strong reservations on many of the recommendations of the Subramanian committee, such as on fast tracking projects and proposal of developing a new law which is largely clearance-centric.
The CSE - New Delhi-based environment think-tank -- has, however, appreciated the HLC's observations on multiplicity of laws and processes, and the need for improvement in compliance and enforcement.
""A review of our environmental laws has become an absolute necessity as the existing systems are not working well. We need major reforms in green laws and institutions that implement these laws,"" said the CSE.

NGT cancels green nod for super-specialty hospital at Faridabad,The Times of India (TOI),8/27/2015,ENVIRONMENT,"CHANDIGARH: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday set aside the environmental clearance granted by Haryana's State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) to an industrial house for setting up a 450-bed super-specialty hospital at Faridabad on a plot marked for building an educational institution for dalit students.
The tribunal also directed the promoters of the project to pay around Rs 11.5 crore for ""restoration of the damaged environment and for starting and completing the project without obtaining environmental clearance"".
The four-member bench, headed by Justice Swatantar Kumar, passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Faridabad resident Krishan Lal Ghera. In its 91-page verdict, the bench, however, refused to order the demolition of the hospital at this stage but asked the state government to constitute an independent committee to inspect the site and make recommendations to ensure that the project promoters complied with all the relevant laws, particularly in relation to the protection of environment, ecology, water and air pollution.
The committee has been directed to give its findings within 45 days and till then the NGT has stayed all construction work at the site.
Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Narender Hooda submitted that while granting environment clearance for the hospital on November 26, 2014, SEIAA had not taken into consideration the fact that the land was allotted for building a Harijan residential school. Instead of seeking prior environmental clearance, the permission was granted after the construction work started, the lawyer pleaded before the NGT. ""Apparently, this is the biggest fraud played by proponents of the project and all the public authorities have remained a mute spectator to this,"" Hooda said.
The case pertains to plot number 1 in sector -16, Faridabad, measuring 5 acres, which was allotted by HUDA to a Vivekanand Ashram on leasehold basis for setting up Harijan Residential School and Social Development Centre in 1978. The land, however, remained vacant till 2003.
On July 11, 2003, HUDA granted permission to the society to open a dental college subject to some conditions, including approval from the Dental Council of India and providing exemption in fee to economically weaker section candidates. Later, the new governing body of the society started establishing a super-speciality hospital called QRG Central, which is owned by Qimat Rai Gupta, founder chairman of electrical equipment company Havells India.
The NGT has also directed Haryana chief secretary to conduct an inquiry and fix responsibility of officers who had ignored vital facts in this case that paved the way for granting environmental clearance for the project.
NGT observations
Authorities like SEIAA are the highest authorities in the state administration and the development of the state depends upon their decision making process. Higher the authority, greater is the need for acting with care, responsibility and in adherence to the laws in force.
Undue hurry in granting the environmental clearance, even without the compliance report, does not speak well of the authorities in relation to discharge of their statutory functions.

How Ford Motor Company paint shop in Sanand has cut VOC and CO2 emissions,The Times of India (TOI),9/17/2015,INDIA BUSINESS,"CHENNAI: The new Ford Motor Company paint shop in India, established by D\xFCrr in Sanand and officially inaugurated this March, is perhaps the current benchmark on the Indian market in terms of energy consumption, paint finish quality and cost per unit.
""We are not only achieving lower VOC and CO2 emissions here, but are also realizing the highest paint finish quality, in terms of our customer's individual requirements,"" said Hans Schumacher, head of the D\xFCrr Division Application Technology, outlining the automated paint process in Sanand.
The core components in the new paint shop are, along with pretreatment, cathodic electrocoating and fully automatic paint application, a high-performance pollution control system for reducing VOC emissions, a heat recovery system for oven heating and highly efficient electrical pumps for paint circulation.
The paint line in Sanand was conceptualized by Ford, according to the so-called 3-wet-paint technology. Three paint layers (primer, base coat and clear coat) are applied one after the other in this paint process, then dried together in a subsequent step. This not only saves space because complete drying can be forgone after the primer painting, but is also highly energy efficient.
Right from the beginning, the paint process by Ford Sanand is about quality and performance: In pretreatment the white body is initially cleaned, phosphated and provided with a first even coating during the subsequent cathodic electrocoating (EC). D\xFCrr applies its Ecopaint RoDip process here.
In this process, the car body is dipped into the dip tank and conveyed through the tank, rotating on its transverse axis. The car body is initially cleaned evenly by this rotation. Subsequently, a high-quality corrosion protection treatment is performed in the EC process, in which primer paint is applied.
After the EC, the individual spot-welded seams of the primed car body are sealed in a D\xFCrr sealing plant. An underbody sealant that protects the vehicle from stone-chipping and corrosion is applied here simultaneously. This process is fully automated with eight EcoRS D\xFCrr standard robots and can be reprogrammed flexibly for other car body types, if necessary.
Following this, the cleaning system Ecopaint Clean removes loose dirt particles from the car bodies. Rotating feathers swipe over the car body's outer skin, gathering and removing the dust lying on it.
For the 3-wet-paint process specific to Ford, the car bodies branch into two lines. A total of 32 paint robots of the type EcoRP L033 apply the primer paint, as well as the base coat and clear coat, in three directly consecutive steps. All robots are equipped for this task with the proven high speed rotating atomizer EcoBell2.
The innovative air conditioning EcoSmart AC ensures optimum air management and thus contributes additionally to the high paint finish quality at Ford in Sanand. Even with the climatic challenges typical for India, such as high temperatures and humidity, the air conditioning performs precisely and is stable long-term.
This reduces energy consumption significantly by up to 30% and simultaneously lowers the production costs. The investment in EcoSmart AC pays off within a year. ""This is how, a new benchmark has been set in the Indian market by the interaction of the innovative plant technologies by D\xFCrr and the internal Ford paint process,"" said Manfred Weil, Head of the D\xFCrr Division Paint and Final Assembly Systems, describing the cooperation with Ford.
Should a robot fail, the required cycle time can be still adhered to via the so-called degrade mode. In this case, the other machines take over the painting scopes of the failed robot and thus continue operating at the same cycle speed. This not only prevents downtime, but reduces the cost per unit sustainably.
The final drying booth and the oven after the EC are also equipped with the D\xFCrr air purification plant Ecopure TAR, which dedusts the process exhaust air by combustion. By means of downstream heat recovery systems, residual heat is returned from the cleaned exhaust air to the manufacturing process. This is how the use of resources and CO2 emissions can be reduced even more.
Once 240,000 passenger cars have rolled off the assembly line at the new Ford factory in Sanand after a year has passed, the vehicles will have undergone a consistently resource-saving paint process of pretreatment, seam sealing, application technology and automation, right up to air pollution control. ""By means of this efficient process, we have succeeded in lowering the consumption of materials and energy significantly, which further cascades to a lower Carbon footprint as compared to conventional painting processes,"" said Girish Kumar, Paint Area Manager of Ford Sanand.

Court To Review Situation Four Months After Levying Tax,The Times of India (TOI),10-10-2015,DELHI,"New Delhi: With SC engaging with Delhi's critically high air pollution levels, seen to pose serious health concerns, amicus curiae Harish Salve presented the outline of the levy proposal to a bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justices Arun Mishra and Adarsh K Goel. The proposal was arrived at after Salve held discussions with solicitor general Ranjit Kumar on behalf of the Centre and senior advocate Dushyant Dave for Delhi government.
The lawyers and the bench agreed to adopt the additional pollution levy of Rs 1,300 on big trucks and Rs 700 on LCVs, as decided by the National Green Tribunal. The bench clarified it would pass the order on suggested lines and direct its strict enforcement for four months. ""We will examine its effect on the pollution front after four months and hear all parties for further improvement and fine-tuning of the order if need be,"" it said.
The court intends to slap the anti-pollution levy on trucks using diesel as fuel and not on those vehicles using cleaner CNG. The levy would be payable by all diesel-run trucks whether they use Delhi roads as transit routes or enter the capital to deliver goods.
The court said it would also exempt passenger buses and mini vans, emergency vehicles and those carrying essential commodities-food grains, fruits, milk, vegetables, all kinds of food stuffs and oil tankers-from the pollution levy.
The bench was worried that collection of additional levy could result in traffic snarls caused by haphazardly queued trucks at the toll booths. But, Salve said, ""facility of collection of toll exists on all entry points into the city. Therefore, collection of environment compensation charge will not entail further delay or inconvenience...to other traffic.""
The toll collecting contractors will hand over the additional levy to the Delhi government on a weekly basis, preferably every Friday. ""The Delhi government may use the money for augmenting public transport and improving the roads, particularly for most vulnerable users-cyclists and pedestrians,"" he said.
The court also accepted the suggestion that Haryana, UP and Rajasthan governments must prominently advertise the levy for the benefit of truckers and inform them about the alternative routes to bypass Delhi.
Salve pitched for installation of radio frequency identification (RFID) mechanism at every entry point to prevent contractors from allowing entry to trucks without accounting for them on records submitted to the municipal authorities. ""This is why the MCD record shows entry of only 22,000-odd trucks every night into Delhi though independent sources put it at over 38,000. Under the contracts with MCD, the private toll collectors are obliged to put in place RFID systems at their own cost, but it has not yet been done. A direction is necessary that RFID facility be installed across all 127 entry points,"" he said.
""This RFID system should be installed by November 2015 at the nine main entry points, from where 75% of the commercial traffic enters Delhi. All remaining entry points should be covered with RFID facility by January 2016. If this is not done by the stipulated deadline, then the contractors would be treated as being in breach of their obligation,"" Salve said.
In 1998, three years after the lawyer had filed his case and as a direct result of it, the Supreme Court published a directive that specified the date of April 2001 as deadline to replace or convert all busses, three-wheelers and taxis to CNG. In addition, the directive specified that an infrastructure of 70 CNG refuelling stations had to be made available, and asked for financial incentives for the conversion of vehicle fleets.

Okhla residents to move court over waste plant,The Times of India (TOI),11/21/2015,ENVIRONMENT,"NEW DELHI: Residents of Sukhdev Vihar have decided to move the Supreme Court seeking a solution to the air pollution caused by Okhla waste-to-energy plant. On Thursday, officials from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) inspected the plant following an NGT order, which is currently hearing the residents' petition.
While the officials claimed that the plant did not violate norms, residents were not convinced. According to residents, the only solution is to either move the plant from its current location or shift the DDA colony. ""Inspections have been conducted several times and emission samples have been tested. It's not helping. The plant is about 150m from our flats. We are living in fear that the toxic emissions could affect the health of one lakh residents,"" said Ranjit Devraj, a resident.
NGT had directed the plant authorities to put in place infrastructure to segregate the 1,900 metric tonnes of solid waste that's delivered to them. ""At this stage, it will be premature to conclude anything about the analysis of the samples of ambient air quality as the report is awaited. However, we direct the project proponent to take steps...so that segregation of solid waste is complete and does not result in mix waste being put into the furnaces,"" the bench had ordered. The plant is said to have ordered a shredder that can help segregate waste.
""The waste coming to the plant is already mixed as waste segregation is not mandatory in Delhi. I don't understand how can that be segregated properly? Getting a shredder doesn't guarantee the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) technology will be used,"" added Devraj.
Residents had approached NGT alleging that the plant uses ""reciprocating stoker-type boilers of Chinese origin"", which is being phased out even in China due to their pollution potential. Waste is shredded, dried, baled and then burnt to produce energy with the help of RDF technology while biomethanation is where methane is produced by using microbes on organic municipal waste.
But CPCB officials said ""the plant's performance is much better now. They (the plant) have promised to improve the efficiency of pollution control devices. Emissions are also under control"".
But residents are unfazed. ""I am a scientist and I know what they are discussing is will not address pollution. We are guinea pigs exposed to their emissions. Why can't they shift our colony if they can't shift the plant?"" said Umesh Bahri, another resident.

"Why no smog alert, EPCA asks city govt",The Times of India (TOI),11-05-2015,DELHI,"New Delhi: Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) on Wednesday asked the Delhi environment secretary, Ashwani Kumar, why a smog alert has not been issued despite the air quality deteriorating severely in the last three days.
EPCA member Sunita Narain asked why emergency measures like closing schools and guidelines for preventing exposure are not being issued. ""We want to know what emergency action will you take?"" she asked. When the levels of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) reaches 250 micrograms per cubic metre, its considered critical.
Kumar said, ""Schools will not be closed in Delhi because of air pollution."" He added boards with real-time data on air quality and preventive measures will come up soon.

A happier diwali ... without crackers,The Times of India (TOI),11/14/2015,NAGPUR,"NAGPUR: Slowly, but surely, the government's appeal to refrain from bursting crackers seems to be getting the thumbs-up from citizens. Be it mass awareness about environment or loss of interest, many feel that crackers are losing their charm with passing years.
Co-founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said that there was a 20-25% downfall in the use of crackers. ""Previously, we were surrounded by loud noises of deadly polluting firecrackers. But, this year, we hardly heard much sound of bombs on Diwali as well as the second day,"" he said.
Adding that changing mindsets are the main reason behind the subdued bursting of crackers, Chatterjee said that people are getting more alert about health and environmental issues.
Nagpur Municipal Corproation's zonal officer of health department (Dharampeth) Deendayal Tembhekar said that the crackers' leftovers on streets was less this year. ""Specifically in West and Central Nagpur, it has been noticed that not many people burned crackers. With so many NGOs and media houses raising environmental concerns, the message is reaching out to masses,"" he said.
Till last year, Meherlal Joshi and his family members used to burn a lot of crackers for the entire week. It was some discussions on social media that made them thinking and finally they pledged to avoid bursting the usual crackers. ""To keep up the spirit of festivities, my kids this time went for parachute bombs and other illumination-based crackers which create no air or noise pollution,"" he said.
Joshi, who stays in Dharampeth, agreed that many people like him now prefer celebrating the festival of lights in its true spirit.
""Till last year, it was impossible for us to go to a temple in our area due to immense cracker explosion. But this time, the number of people out on streets was very less,"" he said.
Mahendra Lule, a resident of Laxmi Nagar, shared the same views. ""This year, when I left my house for a walk after 10pm, the sky was much clearer and the streets and roads were quite peaceful. I feel Diwali definitely has been more eco-friendly than before and the future generations will give up crackers. We weren't exposed much to environmental awareness, but my kids are privileged and they know the ill-effects of crackers on environment,"" he said.
For those shying away from crackers, this Diwali was more about delicacies and other festivities. ""This Diwali was all about good food, ethnic attire and selfies. Radio stations and television ads helped people getting more aware about the demerits of crackers,"" said Sakkardara resident Aisha Khalatkar.
She added that various means of mass media have contributed to the growing awareness and will soon bring an impactful change.
With Diwali coming between peak exam season, students heaved a sigh of relief as they got to concentrate more with less sound pollution. ""It was comfortable for me to study last night as the noise was very low. People are becoming aware about environment and very soon we'll see changed Diwali celebration. Our focus should be more on lights and diyas rather than crackers and noise,"" said a student Kushal Baid.
Still, there were some who felt that the change is not enough. ""Though the scale of burning crackers from 6-7 pm onwards wasn't like before, people got active after 8pm in our locality. For bringing about a change, civic agencies as well as citizens will have to come together,"" said Chanda Sinhababu, a resident of Medical Square.

Shinzo Abe to visit Varanasi: Will the air quality make him wear a mask?,The Times of India (TOI),12-09-2015,VARANASI,"Varanasi: The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will have to spend time in severely polluted atmosphere full of particulate matters in the air during his visit to Varanasi. Abe along with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi is arriving here on December 12.
The city's air quality index (AQI) was 404, which is hazardous, on Monday, and it suggests for wearing a N95 mask while going outdoors. It is also suggested to try to stay indoors during the most polluted hours of a day, which is normally from dawn till dusk. The elderly persons, pregnant women, babies and sick sensitive persons are advised to stay indoors in such severe air quality.
The AQI is a 'One Number- One Colour-One Description' for the common man to judge the air quality within his vicinity. The formulation of the index was a continuation of the initiatives under Swachh Bharat Mission envisioned by the PM Modi. There are six AQI categories, namely Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. The AQI will consider eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb) for which short-term (up to 24-hourly averaging period) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed.
The credit for such a poor AQI mainly goes to digging roads and vehicle exhaust, believes environmental scientist at Banaras Hindu University Prof. BD Tripathi, adding that the primary pollutants are PM 2.5 (particulate matters with size less than 2.5 micron) in the air. ""The unplanned digging of roads for various purpose and delay in completing the works is the main reason behind the increasing level of dust in the ambient air. Besides, the frequent traffic jams and increasing number of vehicles add further woes to the problem,"" said Tripathi.
The regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board Dr. Sikander also seconded Tripathi's views and added that other factors like construction sites and reducing greenery are also responsible for it. Tripathi said that there should be emergency action to protect the population when air pollution levels are at alarming stage. There should also be dust control measures at construction sites and roads, he added.
The Central Pollution Control Board along with State Pollution Control Boards has been operating National Air Monitoring Program (NAMP) covering 240 cities of the country. In addition, continuous monitoring systems that provide data on near real-time basis are also installed in a few cities. The city also has a real-time monitoring station at Ardhali Bazar. According to the UPPCB official, more such stations would be created in the city in future.

Time-bound steps to cut pollution,The Times of India (TOI),1/31/2016,GURGAON,"Gurgaon: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has prepared a timeline to reduce air pollution in Gurgaon.
The step scores high on intention but its big challenge will be implementation because Gurgaon's government agencies have a poor track record when it comes to enforcement. The ban on plastic bags, which has seen just 23 fines in five years, is an example.
The step was taken after the Union environment ministry and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) together issued a string of directives to all agencies in the Delhi airshed area to lower pollution and improve air quality in Delhi-NCR.
Following this, CPCB issued 42 specific directions to the state governments of Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the second week of December, and asked all agencies to communicate the status of their implementation before January 31.
On Thursday, HSPCB issued a letter to Haryana urban local bodies department and Gurgaon pollution control board that directed them to work on an immediate three-point agenda to reduce air pollution. According to the letter, strict action should be taken against burning of biomass/leaves/tyres, etc, in the open. Equal importance has been given to collection of horticulture waste, and enforcement of the ban on burning of agriculture waste and crop residues and fitting diesel vehicles with particulate filters. The letter also states action will be taken against the agencies if they fail to follow the directions within a stipulated time.
""In case you fail to comply with any of the above said directions within the stipulated time schedule as mentioned, further action will be taken against you under provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981,"" states the letter. ""The steps taken by CPCB will help curb air pollution. It is possible to implement the measures with the coordination and support of the city's civic agencies,"" said an HSPCB official.
Long-term measures such as road widening, promotion of battery-operated vehicles and installation of a system to measure air pollution have been given 90 days for implementation. Mechanised sweeping of roads will have to be introduced to deal with road dust, along with the construction of green buffer zones along major traffic corridors, which too should be implemented immediately. ""We are ready to implement the measures in a time-bound manner. We'll make all efforts to make sure directions are implemented within the set time,"" said deputy commissioner T L Satyaprakash.

Hema Malini launches Kent Superb in Delhi,The Times of India (TOI),1/26/2016,DELHI,"Hema Malini was in Delhi recently to launch the latest product of Kent RO - Kent Superb, which is one of world's first smart purifiers. They also launched the Arsenic Remover Gravity Purifier at this event.
The actress, who has been the brand ambassador of the company for a decade now, felt nostalgic at the unveiling ceremony and said, ""I have been associated with this brand for the last 10 years and it has been wonderful. We've launched many products together and with advanced technology every time. Since Delhi is so polluted, water and air purifiers are most essential to me.""
Spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who was the chief guest on the occasion, had to cancel his visit at the last minute and communicated via video chat. He spoke about the importance of purified water and said that water and love are synonyms in Sanskrit. He said, ""Shudh paani ki bahut avashyakta hai aaj ke samay mein. Kehte hain teesra vishwayuddh agar hua to paani ko lekar hoga. Paani ka sanrakshan aur shuddh jal ki prapti avashyak hai."" Remarking on Hema Malini's association with the brand, he said, ""If Hemaji takes on anything, it becomes successful.""
Agreeing with him, Mahesh Gupta, chairman, Kent RO Systems, said, ""She is our brand ambassador for the last 10 years, and I think it is one of the longest associations between a company and its brand ambassador.""
Mahesh, who described the achievements of RO year-wise, said, ""We are always delighted to bring innovative products into the market. Our latest innovation - Kent Superb - is a water purifier which is the world's 1st smart RO purifier model and is different from other products as it comes with digital technology and it senses water quality on real-time basis and displays it on the digital screen.
The user will get to know whether the quantity of water is less or it lacks minerals.""Mahesh also made a presentation about their 2 lakh sqft corporate campus, which was recently inaugurated in Noida.

Forum chalks out plans for pollution-free Kudla,The Times of India (TOI),01-03-2016,MANGALURU,"MANGALURU: With major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore facing alarming increase in vehicular congestion and vehicular air pollution, an organization has come out with suggestions to solve the emerging crisis.
Anti-Pollution Drive (APD), a citizens' initiative, born in Namma Kudla is Kudla is deeply distressed to caution that Mangaluru too is headed in the same undesirable direction. Abdullah A Rehman, founder of organisation expressed that despite the widening and four-laning of all major roads, it is observed that there is no relief to the public and traffic congestion continues to be a problem we encounter every day. Mangaluru has one of the highest vehicle densities in this region. The density exceeds the carrying capacity of our infrastructure.
""The resulting pollution caused by the exhaust of the increasing number of vehicles is translating into steady increase in health hazards. Asthma is observed to be increasing in children and respiratory problems among adults too is on the rise. If no immediate action is taken, Kudla too will soon have to face a Delhi like situation,"" according to Rehman.
Anti-Pollution Drive (APD), is a registered Mangalore non-profit organization. It was established on October 2, 2014, to coincide with 'Swachh Bharat' campaign launched by the Prime Minister Modi.
To curb increasing pollution APD has formulated following suggestions to solve the emerging crisis:
1. Introduce Car Pooling System: This is especially true for Derlakatte-Mangaluru sector where a number of doctors, students and others travel at regular timings. App-based carpooling system would be both practical and highly beneficial.
2. College Transport System and Corporate Transport System should be streamlined to allow for more omni buses and car pooling. Government / RTO could give special incentives or recognitions for such institutions and companies.
3. Public Transport - vehicle maintenance should be given priority. At present lot of smoke emitting vehicles are visible around the city.
4. Verification of Certifying Agencies - It is observed that many vehicles emit high levels of smoke despite possessing mandatory pollution certificates. Though periodical pollution certification is mandatory, there is no mechanism for verifying the certificates and certification standards of the certifying agencies. Hence a verification mechanism is required.
5. Establish Monitoring Station - The city lacks a Pollution Monitoring Station to gather and maintain data on the pollution within the city. The only station in the region is located at Baikampady. A city based station should be established to monitor pollution, analyze and report on the developments.
6. Strict Action on Offenders - At present pollution seems to be a marginalized issue and the authorities are mild in dealing with pollution issues. Authorities should ensure stricter law enforcement against offending vehicles and their owners.
7. Link to Smart City Project - Pollution control should be linked into the proposed Mangalore Smart City project and all plans and proposed developments should factor pollution control too.
According to APD, Hampankatta, Balmatta, Jyothi Circe and Bunts hostels areas more polluted.

Air's clean but don't credit odd-even yet,The Times of India (TOI),01-03-2016,DELHI,"New Delhi: Air pollution came down again on Saturday, the second day of the odd-even scheme, but the cheers were more restrained. While Delhi Government said in a statement that the initial air quality data was ""encouraging,"" air quality experts cautioned against expecting ""unrealistic improvement in air quality.""
The consensus among environment scientists is that conclusions shouldn't be drawn without monitoring pollution levels for at least a week of the odd-even scheme. For now, all they have confirmed is that air quality did improve for a few hours, 7.30am to 8am onwards on Friday, and noon onwards on Saturday.
On Saturday, when Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) discussed whether the NCR states had clamped down on waste burning and dust from construction sites to improve air quality, Delhi Government's monitoring at 24 locations showed that pollution remains high in areas bordering UP, such as Rohtas Nagar, Patparganj, Anand Vihar and Kondli. The concentration of PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) had not fallen uniformly, and ranged from 121 to 226 micrograms per cubic metre. However, the average of 211 \xB5g/m3 was still better than the 250\xB5g/m3 average PM2.5 concentration recorded on January 1, 2015.
Traffic police said 50,000-80,000 cars stayed off Delhi's roads on Saturday.
Without releasing data, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said its five permanent monitoring stations had recorded better air quality on January 1 this year. ""This year's PM2.5 levels on January 1 were 10-12% less than last year's. We will release data for 200 locations in a few days,"" said a DPCC official.
Monitoring by central government agency SAFAR showed that PM2.5 averages over 24 hours on Saturday (169\xB5g/m3) were significantly lower than on Friday (211\xB5g/m3).
Scientists said the average on January 1 may have been higher because of vehicular pollution from the previous night's celebrations. Hourly data from 10 locations showed air pollution declined noon onwards on Saturday. Scientists said higher daytime temperature might have helped disperse the pollutants. ""It's too early to comment on the role of the odd-even rule, but pollution levels have come down marginally,"" said a scientist with SAFAR.
Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Air Quality Index value changed from 391 on Friday to 384 on Saturday, although both figures are in the ""very poor"" category.
Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's (CSE) Clean Air Campaign, also said the picture is still emerging. ""We have to see if the peaks are coming down. It's obvious that overall levels will not change majorly. Depending on what reductions we see Delhi government will have to take other measures like bringing two-wheelers under the odd-even rule, and shutting down Badarpur and other power plants in the next few days."" She added that it would be best to draw conclusions from the data after a few days.

India will continue to be one of the fastest-growing economies: Unilever CEO Paul Polman,The Times of India (TOI),02-09-2016,INDIA BUSINESS,"India is one of the fastest-growing economies and will continue to remain so, says Unilever CEO Paul Polman. India is increasingly taking to the global stage and everyone is realising that its active participation is needed for the world to progress, he says. Edited excerpts:
How do you see India as a market and how do you rate the Narendra Modi government's performance?
Well, now, we are in India - the country we visit once, if not twice, in a year because of the importance it has to the overall Unilever universe. India is a very exciting market and, currently, one of the fastest-growing markets in the world and, I think, in the foreseeable future, all indications are that it will stay (as one). One of the major strengths is its enormous population.
You have a growing population, which nowadays is an exception if you come from the parts of the world like Europe, where I come from. Then another thing we are seeing is the unlocking of the more inclusive society. The Swachh Bharat, Make in India programmes, the Smart City programme. Obviously, they will require a lot of work, obviously we cannot expect miracles tomorrow. But the pillars have been put in place that will result in a better India for everybody. So if it is a better India for everybody, we all will also prosper.
You are in a very exciting period of time. India is increasingly taking to the global stage. Your government showed responsibility - took up Sustainable Development Goals in September last year. And, increasingly, everybody is realising that the world can only progress if India takes an active part. And if India itself is successful, we are proud to be in HUL to be an integral part of it. And as far as the Modi government is concerned, well it's the same thing. People talk about what you have done in 100 days when you become a CEO.
What I have realised is that it is very difficult to be in politics these days. I think from a private sector point of view, we need to play an active part in derisking the political process and be a part of the discussion. I think what you see in India is (it is) in the right direction and it is our responsibility to help accelerate that.
How is India different from last year?
India has clearly stepped up its game. From a global perspective, India keeps performing, whether it's 6-8% growth, whichever way one looks at it, it is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The changes made by the government (are) being noticed by the world. With such a complex, diverse country and 1.2 billion or more population, it's not easy, so I have this huge respect for the work being done. The seeds have been planted and the plants are starting to grow. It will take some time, but there is momentum.
I am confident of the government. But, more than the government, I am confident of the people in the country who are aware of the changes that are happening. Poor people are getting educated and there is financial inclusion. So, I do not worry about HUL, there are good people here. We attract good talent. I am more concerned about how India develops.
From your perch in Unilever, London, are you pessimistic about a global recovery?
I'm saying that I am a realistic optimist. I have always liked to be an optimist because I believe we need to work on a better future for everybody. The fact that last year, the world signed the Sustainable Development Goals and a fairly good start from the COP 21 agreement make me optimistic because at the end of the day, everybody thought, including the Press, that this is not possible. Nobody is going to agree among 90 countries, and at the end of the day, they agreed something quite substantial.
So now it's implementation time. There is no doubt that we have a hard time creating jobs, there is no doubt that geopolitical conflicts are on the rise, not on the decline, the issues of refugee crisis is distracting Europe from the longer-term thing... Then you have the Brexit issue that might disrupt Europe. Europe itself is in some areas moving apart. You have different political directions there. So the whole bloc is not addressing its long-term competitiveness. In America, you are in the midst of an election, which gets all the attention and the politics has come a little bit to a standstill. America's role in the world is changing as well, whether we like it or not.
Then we have the Middle East, where we have a hard time finding a solution where people are suffering. Then because of the slower growth in China, as well as significantly lower oil prices that we see, there are many countries that are under pressure, (countries) which were not under pressure before. The challenge you have here is, I think, climate change. India will be very much affected and you have had two seasons of back-to-back bad monsoons where the rural community has not had the best of luck.
And that is not by coincidence. You have your water tables dropping. Water is becoming more salty, less drinkable. You have air pollution. Half of the most polluted cities in the top 20, not even the top 30, are in India. So whatever way you look at it, the answer becomes obvious that it is better to do something about it. India has discovered that as well. So this is an opportunity for India to really make that transformation. And the world is willing to help.
We have had issues in India due to deflation, rural market slowdown, two years of bad monsoon. Are you happy with the kind of growth you are having?
I look at it on a long-term basis. I look at my seven years. At HUL, we have doubled the business. We have grown at over 12%. This is my eighth year as CEO, but if a country has zero percent growth one year, I actually like that because it wakes them up. We need to work a little harder. In the last 7-8 years, we have outgrown our markets.
We need to work a little harder for that when there are headwinds. So we introduced more brands. That is also the case here. We might buy some brands. We step up our innovation pace. We focus more on execution and, in fact, the answer is we do all of that. Every year, our innovation pipeline has got stronger. We rolled these innovations out to more countries. So we have to set the bar higher. Consumers use more new brands now than in any time in history of Unilever. So you have to do all these things. There is no doubt that you have to do all these things to get the same results than perhaps 10 years ago, but that's fine.
You were among the first to criticise short-termism among shareholders. Today, people like Larry Fink of BlackRock are taking this up and he has written to Fortune 500 CEOs saying: Don't focus on short term. Is there a change in thinking?
Larry works very closely with us. We have created a group of people that is working on what we call capitalism for the long term. We have now brought together about $24 trillion worth of capital on the management, Larry being one of the biggest ones with BlackRock. We are working on trying to change the system so that it changes people's behaviour. You cannot blame people individually for the short-termism. Short-termism comes from the requirement of incentive systems.
For example, if you are a fund manager and you need to beat the market and your salary depends on how well you beat it every quarter, you are going to move the money as if it is a poker play to beat these indexes on a quarterly basis. So, your incentive system influences you. If you are a CEO and your board tells you all the time to deliver and deliver, or your shareholder calls you every day and tells you your share price has to go up, else I will put my money here or there.
If a CEO gets enormous compensation by having the share price go up in the short term, then he starts to behave that way. So we said we need to put a group together under the leadership of McKinsey's Dominic Barton and Mark Wiseman from Canada Pension Plan. Mark and Dominic took up this initiative and wrote two articles in Harvard Business Review that you can see mentions Unilever, and we put a group together of 10 people, myself included, to see how you can go to make these markets function for the long term.
So what does this group do?
We meet a few times and look at what are the things we need to do. For example, we are looking at how we can change the compensation systems around CEOs to make them more long-term focused. There are shareholder services like ISS and others that influence them. We work with these boards so that we see what is the fiduciary duty for the boards.
There is a misunderstanding that has crept into many markets that the fiduciary duty of the board is only to shareholders and often that is interpreted as short-term shareholders. That is not true. It is to ensure long-term viability of the company.
Are you trying to rope Indian CEOs into the capitalism group?
I had a wonderful breakfast in Delhi last Tuesday with these wonderful 20 CEOs from Indian companies that all belong to the World Business Council For Sustainable Development. And that is the major organisation of companies that want to move the world forward. Companies like ICICI, Tatas, Birlas, Mahindras, I do not want to mention them all where the CEOs are leading India in the right direction. Through this business council, we have to share best ideas and practices on how we can accelerate that.
The World Business Council will have its annual meeting in Chennai in October this year. This will give us an opportunity to enrol other people there. The PM will probably be there. So that will get the right attention.
There is this great debate about inequality. What do you think about it? Is it the biggest issue of our times?
The biggest issue is not poverty, it is exclusion. So poverty is relative. Inequality will always be there. Because we all are different. But what you want is equal opportunity. Then there are some basics that you want as well. The right to a job, right to food, right to education, equal rights to women and men. There is no religion that says it has to be different, I haven't found any. Equal opportunity for everyone is the most important thing. And we have started to realise that the world is better if we all have equal opportunities and solve these issues instead of some of us living behind barbed fences.
How much of this is caused by the financial market policies of the developed countries? Because you had asset-price inflation but you did not have good wage growth and you have consumer price deflation.
Now the issue you are raising is different from what you are analysing. The issue that is happening with the financial industry is, because of the Basel agreement, the capital balance the banks need to keep has become so stringent that the banks don't lend anymore. So the original function of banks was forgotten by the banks themselves - which was to help the economy, not be the economy. So that was the crisis of 2007-08 in one sentence. That is why financing has not flown through. And that is the real issue right now.
The cost of capital in India is too high. People say how can I invest in green energy when the capital cost is so high. We need to find blended financial mechanisms. Why we have these disparities is what the economists call the tragedy of the commons. Where one benefit goes to some but the cost to the others. So how do you make a value chain work.
That's why when we were working on the USLP (Unilever Sustainable Living Plan), we said instead of shared value or CSR (corporate social responsibility), we take responsibility of the total value chain. If you don't do that, you cannot solve it. If you do it, you find opportunities that are enormous.
One of the topics at Davos was the fourth industrial revolution and its impact on employment, inequality, etc. What do you think?
Currently, there are 200 million people in the world unemployed. I personally think there are 2.5 billion more who are in the marginal jobs. So, if you see, 200 million is a ridiculous number. The world needs to create 40 million jobs a year because of the population growth, etc. India, by the way, needs to create 15 million jobs a year. So, in India, you might create 5-6 millions jobs a year probably. So it is difficult with our industrial revolution. Because, in India, you are in the second part of the revolution.
Think about the wealth of robotics, driverless cars, people-less checkout counters in supermarkets. You can see it is enormous job destruction. Some people say it will be around 1.8 billion. Now people should not be deprived of technology. For example, if drones could deliver drugs during a heart attack, hard to argue that it is not right. You can make financial inclusions and automatic bank transfers. Some of the jobs are very dangerous, people lose their lives, but they are now automated. Alzheimer's is a big problem and if you can get implants... so you should not stop advancement.
The industrial revolution gives us a lot of solutions to lift people out of poverty, so we will embrace it but at the same time we have to think how can we use it so that it is inclusive. For example, you cannot solve the issue of employment if you do not solve the problem of food security and issue of smallholder farmers. For that, you have to solve the issues of land rights and sustainable farming. You have to solve the issue of youth, otherwise we cut down money more fast. So, it becomes a value chain issue.

Will soon need choppers for emergencies: HC,The Times of India (TOI),02-05-2016,DELHI,"New Delhi: Emergency services in the capital may soon have to rely on choppers, the Delhi high court observed on Thursday, commenting on the increasing traffic in the city.
A division bench, comprising Justices B D Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva, made the remark after learning from traffic police that at least 14 spots/corridors/junctions suffer from extreme congestion, sending traffic movement into a tailspin.
The court said Delhi government must seriously consider introducing emergency air services in the wake of traffic jams being common across the city. The bench pointed out that, in an emergency situation, ambulances and police vehicles face delay due to snarls.
But the bench was also cautiously optimistic about pollution levels in the city, saying that 2015 was not as bad as previous years. It was referring to scientific data filed by the state pollution control panel.
""Conclusion of DPCC report seen... and general impression one gets is that 2015 was better from scientific point of view. But it doesn't mean the situation is not far from great as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide and benzene levels were beyond the maximum prescribed,"" the bench observed, adding that vehicles are to be blamed for high level of benzene and nitrogen dioxide in the air.
Delhi Pollution Control Committee had filed the report in a public interest matter being heard by HC to figure out ways to reduce air pollution.
Meanwhile, in its report, Delhi Police included IIT Flyover to Panchsheel (Hauz Khas Metro station), Gurgaon Road-Dhaula Kuan/RR Hospital, Ashram Chowk, Khanpur T-Point, ISBT Kashmere Gate, Mukarba Chowk, Uttam Nagar Chowk, Peera Garhi Chowk and Kamal T-Point as some of the choke points in the capital.
Other junctions include G T Road Shastri Park, Saket Metro station, Akshardham, Mayur Vihar Metro station and Rao Tula Ram Marg from Moti Bagh Chowk up to Outer Ring Road. Police contended that its priority during peak hours is regulation of traffic and not booking violators.
""Directions have been issued to the traffic personnel to avoid challaning of vehicles during the peak hour traffic as it not only leads to further congestion, but also engages the available manpower on field in prosecution process,"" the report said.
The bench asked why traffic police does not develop an app like Google Maps showing congestion or the shortest or alternate route to any destination.
After going through the report, HC wondered why the city police still lacks technology to alert commuters about unfolding traffic snarls across the city, so that they can avoid these routes.
""If Google can do it, then why can't you? You should also develop an application to warn citizens of congestion under the Intelligent Traffic Management System. Bumper-to-bumper driving in the evening also contributes to pollution,"" the bench said.
The bench was informed by Delhi government that dismantling of BRT corridor was under process and will be completed by March-end.

"Stench from nullah, polluted air suffocate Koparkhairane residents",The Times of India (TOI),02-03-2016,NAVI MUMBAI,"NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of sectors 1 and 11 in Koparkhairane have complained about stench from a nullah and air pollution causing breathing and skin-related problems.
Vikram Nanda, who shifted from Sanpada to the node around one-and-half years ago, said, ""Ever since we changed homes, my youngest son, Yuveer, has had to use the asthma pump. A test showed high level of allergy. My elder son and I have also taken a health hit. There is air pollution from the nearby railway yard because of loading of stone chips while the nullah emanates a foul odour. It is always safe to be indoors because the air gets hazy due to the pollution.""
Vikram Tomar of sector 1 said that he was facing skin related problems and also the nullah in his area emanated a bad stench.
""We are monitoring the health of residents and also aiding them to get appropriate action. Pollution is a problem in the area and the MPCB ought to take action against those units flouting norms,"" said Hemant Sharma from NGO Disha Parivartan Foundation.
MPCB, regional officer, N Lohalkar, said that they had issued a showcause notice to one unit as its air monitoring equipment was found to be non-compliant with the norms and that units to be held responsible for pollution are under investigation.
The president of sector 11's association had written to the principal secretary of environment on January 28 seeking action.
""The action taken report provided is not satisfactory. We assume that many companies are not given showcause notices or are being identified for action. Also, pollution has not been controlled in sector 11. With this kind of functioning, a mishap cannot be ruled out,"" he added.

Gujarat govt mulls taking old diesel vehicles off roads,The Times of India (TOI),3/20/2016,AHMEDABAD,"Ahmedabad: In order to curb air pollution in the city limits, the state government has submitted its action plan before Gujarat high court (HC) and said that it would not allow re-registration of diesel vehicles that are more than 20 years old. It has also decided to ban diesel run auto rickshaws in municipal areas. However, the transport department has made it clear that though it mulls to prohibit two-decade old diesel vehicles in Ahmedabad, the power ultimately lies with the Centre as per the Motor Vehicle Act. 
The state government will seek legal opinion to deal with this issue, the government stated in an affidavit on Friday.The transport department's insistence on elimination of more than 20-year old diesel vehicles is mainly based on its small survey conducted in and around the city. It reflected that 40% of such old vehicles were found exceeding the permissible limits of pollution -65% PSU. ""The government will consider issue of fixing the life span of commercial and public transport vehicles and restrict the re-registration of diesel driven commercial vehicle older than such fixed age in accordance with the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act,"" the affidavit reads.The government has decided to ban diesel run auto rickshaws from April 1 in the city limits, where CNG is available. Permits obtained for such auto rickshaws will not be renewed. The government has said that it will re-introduce the down count timer on traffic signals at all major traffic junctions. The traffic congested zones are to be identified to manage traffic to reduce pollution. A committee of experts from GPCB officials and police under the chairmanship of RTO will be formed for inspection of commercial and public transport vehicles, which are required to be scraped. The defaulters in obtaining PUC for vehicles will be fined with Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 for second time defaulters. Earlier, the penalty was Rs 400.

"Increased use of diesel gensets causing spike in air, noise pollution",The Times of India (TOI),4/28/2016,BAREILLY,"Bareilly: The frequent power cuts in the city have resulted in an increase in the use of diesel generators. Experts said that as more than 15,000 generator sets are now running in the city for over six hours every day, it is causing a significant rise in both air and noise pollution. Besides, as most of the generators have been illegally kept on roadsides, it is causing passers-by also to inhale the toxic gases emitted by them.
In summer, the use of generators increases in areas suffering power cuts. The chimney attached to generator sets emit respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, while the generators without canopy or proper enclosure result in noise pollution.
Though the local authorities have conducted no survey to determine the data on pollution caused by diesel generators, experts said that pollution is on the rise because of their excessive use. The generators without canopy which make noise of nearly 80 decibels can be found across the city, including Civil Lines, Choupla, Jawahar Market, Shamatganj and DD Puram. Even many commercial complexes, hospitals, offices and banks have installed generators with capacity of 50 to 100 kilovolt (KV) which lack proper enclosures, causing noise pollution.
""In a few residential colonies, including Civil Lines, some offices have come up which have installed big generators causing a rise in noise pollution. However, there is nobody to take action against them,"" said Smiriti Singh, a housewife.
DK Saxena, professor emeritus at botany department of Bareilly College who is in-charge of Air Pollution Monitoring Centre in Bareilly said, ""As per World Health Organisation (WHO), the smoke emitted from disease generators is carcinogenic in nature. Besides, the old generators or local-made generators release 200-400 times more pollutants than the current one. Even small generators of capacity of up to 10 KV emit smoke more than the larger ones. Local authorities should check that people are not using old generators which lead to high air pollution.""
When contacted, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), RK Tyagi said, ""We are authorised to take action against generator sets installed in industrial areas.""
On being asked who would be taking action against rising pollution levels due to these gensets, Tyagi said, ""Most of the generator sets of commercial complexes have been illegally kept on footpath or roadsides. If they had keep these generators in their own complex, they would be the only ones to inhale the toxic smoke. By keeping it on pavement, the commuters have also been exposed to it. The Bareilly Municipal Corporation should take action against such commercial establishments.""
City health officer, Dr Ashok Kumar said, ""We have a clause of issuing challans if anyone has encroached on pavements, but it is a long process. For conducting a drive, we need help of other government agencies, including officials of UPPCB and administration and police force.

Truck traffic in Delhi has declined by half,The Times of India (TOI),04-01-2016,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of a Supreme Court hearing on Thursday, the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) convened an urgent meeting of Delhi government, rest of the NCR states and private cab and app-based cab operators on Wednesday.The EPCA members said that almost all the SC directions to control air pollution in Delhi, given on December 16, were being complied with. In fact, data submitted by the authorities show a major decline - in the range of 40% to 50% - in truck traffic entering the city after the environment compensation charge (ECC) was doubled on that date. Though the data needs to be verified by an independent study, they welcomed it as a major and positive development.Light commercial vehicles that were paying an ECC of Rs 700 were asked to pay Rs 1400 and trucks that were paying Rs 1,300 were asked to pay Rs 2,600. The EPCA, in a status report filed in the SC on February 9, had submitted that the imposition of ECC had resulted in a 19-20% reduction in the number of commercial vehicles entering the city and a 35% drop in particulate matter load from trucks. The si tuation now is even better.Even as the SC's deadline of March 31 to convert all cabs to CNG expires, Ola and Uber gave an undertaking to EPCA that they were in the process of converting all their cabs to CNG. 
Ola said the company will abide by the SC order and that currently the company has over 26,000 CNG cars in its Delhi fleet. The Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters and Tour Operator Association, however, accused the app-based operators of lying. They added that they won't follow the EPCA's directions.""We informed the EPCA members that we do not do point-to-point service in Delhi and, hence, we do not come under the ambit of the SC order. The EPCA has directed us to give an undertaking to the transport department that we cannot convert to CNG because we are tourist cabs,"" said Sanjay Samrat, president of the association.""In the case of national permit diesel taxis, we have said they should not operate in NCR. It's up to them how they pick up or drop in NCR. They have been asked to give an affidavit,"" said EPCA head Bhure Lal. Member Sunita Narain added that they have been told they can use CNG cabs within NCR for pick-up and drop. Indraprastha Gas Limited submitted that 108 CNG stations will come up in NCR and 59 new stations in Delhi.Experts who attended the meeting said almost all public and para transit services are now converting from diesel to CNG in phases. SC is likely to take a crucial decision on whether the ban on diesel SUVs will continue. It had banned the registration of diesel luxury cars with more than 2000cc engines.Advocate Harish Salve had earlier submitted, quoting a recent IIT Kanpur study, that diesel vehicles in many localities contributed to 60%-90% of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) emissions in Delhi. At Vasant Kunj, for instance, they contributed to about 90% of vehicular emissions while in Okhla, it was about 80%. ""Rapid dieselization of cars is of special concern as it is contributing to the pollutants - PM2.5 and NOx - in Delhi. Under the current norms, diesel cars are legally allowed to emit seven times more particulate matter and three times more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars,"" his note had added.

Fireworks at meet over crop burning,The Times of India (TOI),5/19/2016,DELHI,"New Delhi: Sparks flew at the concluding session of the Indo-US workshop on air pollution on Wednesday with experts locking horns over the issue of crop stubble burning. It started after one of them suggested that the state resorting to this practice should be sued. However, all of them agreed on a stringent strategy to ensure accountability, which is key to reducing air pollution levels.
Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment said many participants were acting as if India had just woken up to the air pollution problem. ""If you want to work here, you have to respect the action being taken in the country. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn crop stubble because there are no incentives to discourage burning. They don't have machinery that allows them to bail it and plough it back. Please don't lecture us unless you are sensitive to the challenges here,"" Narain said.
According to Narain, local and global pollution levels are intrinsically linked. ""The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector in the US is increasing. You can help us fix local and we can work together to fix the global problem.""
During the group discussion, the participants discussed if India could have a policy of setting deadlines for the state governments to meet air quality standards. If they failed to meet the deadlines, they could be penalised by withholding central funds for various projects. The US has a similar policy and India could follow suit, the experts said.
One of the panelists, Laki Tisopulos of South Coast Air Quality Management District (SQAMD), said India's air pollution agency is not strong. The way ahead could be to empower CPCB and set deadlines or ""clean air"" targets. There could also be a third-party verification to the process.
Narain said such a system already existed in India but implementation is poor. She spoke about the comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI), which classifies different parts of the country on the basis of pollution, toxicity and other parameters. ""But the data available was very poor so even decision-making has been poor,"" she added.
Narain told TOI that she agreed in principle with the US model under which a highly polluted area draws lesser investment. ""It forces accountability. It is a good model but we need to have basics in place.""

'Unfit' vehicles adding to pollution,The Times of India (TOI),5/13/2016,LUCKNOW,"Lucknow: The urban air quality database released by World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday placed Lucknow at the 18th position among 20-most polluted cities in the world. The concentration of PM2.5 in the city's air is alarmingly 113 micrograms per cubic metre, much higher than the permissible 60 micrograms per cubic metre.
Environmentalists and experts, however, raise concern about the suspended particulate matter (SPM) even smaller than PM2.5 present in Lucknow's air.
''Superfine and ultrafine' particles, PM0.56, PM0.32 and PM0.18, much smaller than PM2.5 and PM10, were found in the air by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) during the post-monsoon assessment of Lucknow's air in November last year.
At present, there are no permissible limits recommended for superfine and ultrafine particles in the country. These particles are so small that they remain suspended in the air and pose major health hazards to humans.
Unfit vehicles plying on city roads, along with an average 10% increase in the number of vehicles every year is the biggest cause of pollution. ""Public transport system has not kept pace with the expansion of the city. There are 300-odd city buses, which is too less for public transport,"" said a transport department official. Three-wheelers plying as public transport are not available on all routes.
Economic growth, on the other hand, has increased the purchasing power of people as they are buying private vehicles. ""Everyone who can afford is free to buy a vehicle. There can't be a law to restrain them from doing so, but it can be done by numerous indirect ways. Strengthening public transport is one,"" he said.
Unauthorised and unfit vehicles are multiplying since there is a huge demand for public transport. Regional Transport Office (RTO), Lucknow conducts on and off drive against unauthorised and unfit vehicles, but that's not enough to flush them out. Unfit vehicles are the biggest cause of air and noise pollution in the city. RTO Lucknow, on an average, seizes 400 unfit vehicles every month. Loading vans are the biggest defaulters.
RTO, at present, does not have an advanced system to check fitness of vehicles. At present, motor vehicle inspector (MVI) checks physical condition of the vehicle and issues a fitness certificate. While on-road vehicles can at the most be checked for their physical condition, to check fitness of off-road vehicles, RTO depends on the next inspection date (NID) certificate, which is issued to all transport vehicles.Rising air pollution level in the city has made Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set up online (live) air quality monitoring stations at three locations in Lucknow, Talkatora District Industrial Centre, Lalbagh, Lucknow west and Central School, Aliganj.These stations monitor pollutants like particulate matter (10 and 2.5), lead, oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. AQI is the 24-hour average of the values recorded by all the stations in the city.

Database on sources of air pollution in Ahmedabad nearly ready,The Times of India (TOI),06-10-2016,AHMEDABAD,"Ahmedabad: One of the largest inventories of emission sources that contribute to the ambient air pollution in the city is almost complete. It took a dedicated team of System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences and the Indian Institute of Public Health, working with a group of student volunteers from St Xavier's College and other city-based colleges, almost a month to prepare the large database. 
The programme is being undertaken for the development of the first-ever air quality forecasting system for Ahmedabad. Under this programme, 10 ambient air and weather monitoring stations will be installed at different locations in the city and will provide to citizens real time infor on the quality of air at breathing height. ""The SAFAR programme for Ahmedabad is unique as it will be the first time in the country that all monitoring stations will measure particulate matter (PM) of 1 micrometer. Mumbai and Delhi have just one station each, but Ahmedabad will have all 10 stations measuring PM 1, PM 2.5 and PM 10,"" said SAFAR project director Dr Gufran Beig. The local IMD department office near the airport will be the nodal authority that will monitor different stations. Isro's Space Applications Centre (SAC) will also assist SAFAR programme to help transmit data via satellite communications systems. This too is a first for the country.

"For school students, it will pay to help build plastic roads in state",The Times of India (TOI),6/16/2016,MUMBAI,"Mumbai: The state government will collect waste plastic from school children, besides NGOs and housing societies, to mix with bitumen for road construction, public works department (PWD) officials said on Wednesday.
This, they said, will help eliminate waste plastic, which is destroying the environment. Contractors will pay 8 paisa per kg to those contributing the plastic but it is unclear how the waste will be collected and stored, and how money will be disbursed to schools and NGOs. The state's road engineers said a system would have to be evolved.
The PWD came up with a GR on Tuesday, permitting civic bodies and infra agencies to go ahead with a mix of plastic and asphalt, as it would prevent potholes during the monsoon and thus save on frequent recarpeting of roads. The move, said sources, is also expected to break the nexus between officials, politicians and contractors in relaying roads.
It will save asphalt and help reuse plastic waste to reduce pollution. ""Otherwise, the plastic either goes with the garbage and remains untreated, to create soil pollution, and also air pollution in case of fires at garbage dumps,"" a civic official said.
Civic road engineers, who struggle to lay bitumen layers, welcomed the move and said such a mix would be durable. But they too were clueless about how contractors will disburse money for the waste collected.
Senior PWD officials said agencies involved in road projects may help contractors stock the waste, such as carrybags, water bottles and milk packets, and in disbursing the money.
But Ashish Singh principal secretary, PWD, said the government was unaware about school children being involved in collecting plastic waste.
""We have issued a government resolution saying that contractors should use waste plastic in road construction. It is the contractors' responsibility to get plastic water bottles and how to use them.""
Singh added, ""We hope to do at least 100km of green roads this year."" A senior PWD official said next year's target would be 1,000km.
""There is a lower probability of you getting potholes during the monsoon,"" he added.
How Bengaluru took high road to save the environment
Rs 342 Cr Was Spent To Asphalt 114 Roads Covering 224Km
Aparajita.Ray
Besides Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka have built asphalt roads blending plastic with bitumen, which have proved to be more durable than ordinary roads. Jaipur and Delhi are not taking the experiment forward though the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has allowed its contractors to use plastic in its upcoming projects.
The Bengaluru municipal corporation spent Rs 342.42 crore to asphalt 114 roads covering 224 km in the last fiscal. Bengaluru was the first city to lay 3,000km of plastic roads that were more durable and in due course eliminated bad quality plastic to save the environment. These roads were mostly built between 2002 and 2012.
The roads have lasted longer and have less potholes as the water does not stay or get absorbed during the rainy season. The roads have helped buried about 20,000 tonnes of plastic that could not be recycled.
In the national capital region, the public works department built two 8km roads in North Delhi. Sources said that though the roads were stronger and lasted longer, the authorities have decided to revert to the old practice. The authorities claimed that plastic roads were not smooth enough for better riding quality and they had financial and technical issues in achieving the perfect blend of plastic and tar.
A km of plastic road consumes about two tonnes of waste plastic and costs 2-3% more than an ordinary road. The contractors buy dry plastic that is thin and is of 40 microns or less from apartments and schools at Rs 8 per kg. Rag-pickers have been employed by them to do the job.
In Jaipur, a stretch of a potholed city road was given a layer of plastic asphalt but the civic body dropped the plan as the cost of building a plant for mixing plastic and tar was high. The proposal came up before the Kolkata corporation seven years ago but it has never seen the light of the day.

NGT takes note of pollution by Talabira,The Times of India (TOI),7/31/2016,BHUBANESWAR,"Bhubaneswar: The National Green Tribunal (NGT), Kolkata bench, has summoned the Sambalpur collector, divisional forest officer and deputy director of mines to appear before it in connection with the alleged pollution being caused by Talabira mines in the district. The NGT had summoned the three officials thrice in the past but they did not comply. 
This time, the NGT has asked them to appear with an explanation. The NGT's direction came following a petition filed by Subash Mohapatra and Hemant Rout alleging that the mine has produced more coal than the permissible limit without approval of the authority concerned. It has also not complied with environment norms.Sankar Pani, the counsel, who appeared on behalf of the two petitioners said because of unscientific dumping of mine remnants, the dumping area has more mine waste than the permissible limit leading to spilling into agricultural and forest land. ""The mine is also discharging untreated waste water into the Hirakud reservoir resulting in water pollution. It is also endangering aquatic life,"" Pani said.The petitioners also mentioned that the mine is causing air pollution and traffic congestion during transportation of coal by truck instead of using conveyer belt. There is also not enough green cover near the mine, which is causing serious environmental hazard, the petition said. They have urged the NGT to direct the Odisha State Pollution Control Board not to renew the consent to operate granted to the mine. The Talabira-I mines consent to operate is valid up to March 31, 2016.

"1% cess on diesel no deterrent, say experts",The Times of India (TOI),8/13/2016,DELHI,"New Delhi: Environmentalists and air pollution experts are disappointed with the Supreme Court order revoking the ban on more than 2,000cc diesel luxury cars. They fear that the imposition of 1% green cess on such vehicles will not act as a deterrent.The SC-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) recently recommended a green tax ranging from 10% to 25%, which would bridge the price gap between petrol and diesel. Some auto companies had, however, offered to pay 1% of the showroom price as an environment compensation charge (ECC). The apex court accepted their suggestion.The formula adopted by EPCA for calculating the green cess was to determine the difference in taxes paid by petrol and diesel car users based on their lifetime fuel consumption.According to Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the voluntary offer by the car industry to pay 1% of ex-showroom cost of a vehicle as ECC won't help curb the use of low-tax diesel in luxury cars in order to reduce public health risk.The think tank, however, welcomed SC's observation that diesel cars should be paying an ECC since they are more polluting than the petrol ones. 
""When all buses, taxis and auto rickshaws have moved out of diesel and trucks are being discouraged with ECC, diesel cars cannot be encouraged,"" a CSE statement said.Amit Bhatt of Embarq said that 1% tax would not discourage customers. ""One way would be to invest all the money generated from this ECC only in public transport. We also need a fuel policy that lays down clearly that petrol and CNG are better suited for city vehicles. The government needs to implement other measures such as congestion charge and a quota for the number of annual registrations of personal cars,"" he said. ""All BS IV diesel cars sold in India today are highly polluting and their exhaust is carcinogenic. We estimate the addition of 10,000 new diesel vehicles in Delhi will cause at least an additional 25 premature deaths,"" said Anup Bandivadekar, programme director (India) at International Council on Clean Transportation. ""A pollution tax of 1% is grossly insufficient-it can neither compensate for the environmental and public health damage caused by these diesel cars nor deter anyone from purchasing a diesel vehicle. Instead, the manufacturers should have been required to sell only those diesel vehicles that are equipped with a particulate filter,"" he added.

SC clears hurdle for Greater Noida Metro,The Times of India (TOI),9/18/2016,NOIDA,"NEW DELHI: Clearing the decks for expansion of Metro rail projects to other cities and construction of dedicated freight corridors by the railways to boost industrialisation, the Supreme Court stayed the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) orders mandating environment clearance for such projects.Removal of the NGT's stay will help Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) complete the Noida-Greater Noida Metro link by the December 2017 deadline. It will also help the railways build Phase II of the dedicated freight corridor which will link industrialized areas in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It will provide connectivity to Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai from Dadri in UP and help in rapid transfer of goods. 
Appearing for DMRC, the pioneer project proponent which has now undertaken work in joint venture in other cities, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said expansion of Metro projects would help commuters leave their cars behind and reduce pollution.Appearing for the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCI), additional solicitor general Maninder Singh told a bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice A M Khanwilkar that the freight corridor was a project of national importance which would keep a large number of cargo trucks, which are a major source of air pollution, off the roads.After hearing the AG and the ASG, the bench wondered why the NGT thought of putting environment clearance clause on these projects. The AG told the court that the NGT orders were unnecessary since the environment ministry had exempted railway projects from green clearance in 2006.Both DMRC and DFCCI moved appeals against NGT's July 5 orders through advocate A D N Rao and said, ""It is a matter of common knowledge that railway projects are not covered under Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 2006 and the provisions of Section 11 of Railways Act, 1989 clearly give power to the railway administration to alter the course of any river, stream or other water courses for the purpose of constructing and maintaining bridges, passages or other works over or under them, either temporarily or permanently .""However, DMRC and railways conceded that if the land allocated to them was leased out to private contractors to build commercial complexes next to railway tracks and stations, then the private contractor had to take environment clearance before starting construction.Requesting the court to stay the NGT order, the AG said, ""The NGT says since Metro rail is building stations, it is occupying a lot of floor area and hence will need environment clearance."" The bench issued notice on the petitions and stayed the NGT orders. The AG said because of the NGT orders, a dozen Metro rail projects were facing uncertainty .""Each Metro project can help take 50,000 cars off the roads. Should such projects need environment clearance when they help reduce pollution drastically?"" he asked.ASG Singh said the dedicated freight corridor would drastically reduce traffic congestion due to movement of cargo trucks.

Smoke screen keeps Delhi-Gurgaon e-way in slow motion,The Times of India (TOI),11-04-2016,GURGAON,"GURGAON: Low visibility caused by smog gave commuters on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway a tough time on Wednesday morning. Even at afternoon, motorists had to drive slowly to avoid accidents.The cloak of haze started to descend upon Gurgaon and NCR late on Tuesday night and engulfed the city by morning. Sensing a traffic rush, as heavy vehicles were allowed to enter the city after two days, inspector Anil Kumar, traffic in-charge for highway and his team braced for a tough day. 
Fortunately, there were no reports of any accident on the expressway, but the first victims of the haze were students who reached their schools late due to low visibility on roads.""I usually take 10 minutes to drive my kids to their school on Sohna Road from my residence in Sector 47. But on Wednesday, it took us 20 minutes to reach there as I had to drive slowly. My wards reached their school late,"" said Tanmay Gupta, a businessman.Office-goers, too, had a tough time on roads as visibility barely improved even though the sun came out later in the day. A marketing executive, Ashish Sahay, told TOI he had to stop his car a number of times on the highway to wipe off moisture from his window panes due to the smog.Others had to turn on their car air-conditioners, despite the chill in the air to escape the pollution. ""I had to cross Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road to reach my office in Udyog Vihar. There is already so much dust on that route due to the ongoing repair work and the haze only made the visibility worse. I had to turn on the air-conditioner as I did not want to roll down the car's windows,"" said Vivek Sharma. Commuters had to turn on their head lights for most of the day.

Gurdwaras all set for cracker-free Gurpurb,The Times of India (TOI),11/14/2016,LUDHIANA,"LUDHIANA: With the city and region reeling under smog for the past few days, managements of several gurdwaras have decided to go for environment-friendly Gurpurb.Jatinder Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Sarabha Nagar, said, ""Considering the rise in pollution and smog, we will go for eco-friendly celebrations. Nobody from gurdwara will burst crackers this time.""He said we would motivate residents to go for plantation drive on Gurpurb this time. 
Besides, the gurdwara has also decided to go for organic langar (community kitchen) as much as possible. The gurdwara committee has tried to reach out to masses with announcements to go for eco-friendly celebrations and has even pasted posters in gurdwara to spread awareness.Sandhu added, ""Even during nagar kirtan, we won't create any sort of pollution. To tackle waste, we will serve langar in steel plates instead of plastic ones.Pritpal Singh, president of Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, said, ""Guru Nanak Jayanti is celebrated to spread happiness, not to harm environment. So on Gurpurab, no crackers will be burst. There will be a flower shower after kirtan.

'One more monitoring system need of the hour',The Times of India (TOI),11-08-2016,GURGAON,"GURGAON: Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has expressed the need to install at least one more air pollution monitoring system in the city, as air pollution touched alarming levels in the city over the past few days.""It won't take more than 15 days to get approval from our state head office to install a new air pollution monitoring machine, as the board will get aid from the Centre for it,"" said a HSPCB official, requesting anonymity. He added, ""The challenge has been getting land allotted to install the machine. We need a plot of 1,000 sq yd to install it, and mark a no-disturbance zone around the device.""While Delhi has 12 air monitoring stations, Millennium City has only one. 
In 2012, a team from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) considered three locations - Iffco Chowk, Vikas Sadan near Rajiv Chowk and Cyber City - for installing a stationary air pollution monitoring machine. Eventually, Vikas Sadan was chosen as the site as it was the only land available.The system was installed in 2014 at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. Since then, the board has been relying on this stationary machine, which is effective around a 4km radius of Vikas Sadan. Experts also upheld the need to have more monitoring machines, get a clearer picture of the level of air pollution. ""There is only one machine here, some 20km away from the city's congested areas such as DLF Cyber City, MG Road and Golf Course road.

1 dead as smog engulfs Bareilly,The Times of India (TOI),11-09-2016,BAREILLY,"BAREILLY: The unprecedented level of air pollution enveloping National Capital Region (NCR) has now spread to western Uttar Pradesh reducing visibility to a low usually seen between December 25 and January 10, the peak winter days, due to low temperatures, humidity and absence of wind. On Sunday morning, poor visibility resulted in a pile-up on National Highway 24 involving eight vehicles. 
One person was killed and six persons were injured. The condition of one of the injured is stated to be serious.According to sources, owing to low visibility conditions, two trucks collided at about 7:30 am on Bilwa flyover in Bhojipura. This triggered a pile-up as vehicles going towards Lucknow began colliding into the first crash site, resulting in injuries to half-a-dozen commuters.""We were on board a DCM truck carrying domestic goods to our village at Riccha, Bareilly when our vehicle suddenly collided with another vehicle on Bilwa flyover. There were several repeated impacts of collision, after which I fell unconscious,"" said Mohammed Yakub, 55. According to a witness, the collision between trucks was followed by a pile-up due to low visibility on the flyover. Some onlookers tried to make noise to deter incoming vehicles from crashing into the pile-up.The smog condition has made roads more vulnerable to accidents, with similar pile-ups being reported from other parts of NH 24. Around a dozen vehicles collided on NH 24 in Hapur, leaving another half a dozen injured. No fatalities have yet been reported from there.At least 12 people were injured in a pile-up of over 20 vehicles on Yamuna Expressway near Delhi on Thursday .

"Noida's air, and home of birds, under assault",The Times of India (TOI),12-11-2016,NOIDA,"Noida: A bonfire of dried leaves, twigs and tree branches continues to rage on a stretch leading up to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS), a few steps away from its entrance at the Noida end, despite a standing ban on leaf burning imposed by the National Green Tribunal.The fire is steadily spreading on the horticultural waste lying on the kilometre-long stretch, with no one to care a fig for the lasting damage the smoke is doing to the environment. The green waste is set on fire periodically.The burning of horticultural waste in the area, which is part of the eco-sensitive zone of the OBS, is now a routine affair.Officers and forest guards stationed at the sanctuary told TOI that the horticultural waste was being set on fire by Noida Authority workers themselves. The waste is dumped in the area for some days and then someone turns up one fine day and sets it on fire, an OBS official said.Strangely enough, the Noida Authority's horticulture department feigned ignorance about dumping of waste or the burning. 
""The side of the road where the waste is burning is not under our jurisdiction, we can't say who is burning the leaves there,"" Om Bir Singh, director, horticulture, said.""The Noida Authority has repeatedly been advised to not burn horticultural waste in the city. We have told them many times too, especially with the NGT regulations in place, it is a serious violation of the rules. I shall ask them to stop this immediately,"" B B Awasthi, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, said.Burning of crop stubble and horticultural waste is a major cause of high air pollution level in the NCR during winter months.

Madhya Pradesh government to slap heavy penalty and spot fine for burning solid waste,The Times of India (TOI),12/20/2016,BHOPAL,"BHOPAL: Taking a lesson from alarming level of air pollution because of heavy smog in Delhi, the Madhya Pradesh government has decided to slap heavy penalty and spot fine for burning solid waste and hazardous material in the open.""The spot fine may vary up to Rs 50,000 and it is for the first time that such a rule has been imposed,"" said officials in the state urban development, housing and environment department.As per a notification issued by the department to all municipal corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats, smog and fog had stalled routine activities in metros, including Delhi and its satellite townships. To avert a situation like this in cities here, the state government has decided to implement Section 18 (1) B of Prevention and Control of Pollution Act under Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which clearly suggests stringent measures to control solid waste disposal in the open.The department emphasised that under the Solid Waste Management Rule, 2016, all the municipal bodies should ensure proper disposal of domestic waste, waste from puja and religious functions, agriculture waste, disposal of plastic and polythene besides paper and civic waste. ""Those found burning any of these wastes in the open should be slapped with spot fine,"" said the department notification.It further said that municipal bodies should form inspection teams to visit and examine places falling under their jurisdiction and create awareness among the public. 
It further said that agriculture and crop waste, biomass and waste from trees and plants should be utilised in manufacturing bio-fertiliser that could be used in gardens. ""Waste material to be burned should be given to power plants and civic administration should make arrangements for transportation,"" said officials.The department has also mentioned of timely removal of waste material from dumping areas, especially during the night or early in the morning so that the same could be disposed of before being burned.

'No chemical used on Kotla pillar',The Times of India (TOI),12-06-2016,DELHI,"New Delhi: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has denied any chemical treatment of the Ashokan pillar at Ferozeshah Kotla in the past 20 years. Officers of its science department, based in Dehradun, are likely to visit the site next week to start a full-scale investigation to determine the reasons behind the flaking and deterioration of the pillar. After preliminary investigations, ASI has said the decay might have been caused by air pollution and exposure to the nature. 
""This couldn't have happened in a short time. It would have been evolving over decades and then got accelerated for some reason. Once the investigation is over, we will plan its structural conservation and stabilise the existing inscriptions on a priority basis,"" said ASI director (science branch) V K Saxena. In the past 20 years or so, ASI has only ""done scientific cleaning and preservation. The quality of the stone is such that we try to monitor them as much as possible despite having limited staff,"" he said, ruling out any possibility of the inscriptions getting damaged by chemicals. The science branch, set up in 1917, primarily looks after chemical treatment and preservation of museum exhibits and the antiquities under national protection. It also studies causes of any deterioration for better preservation.Sources in the culture ministry said it was critical to know if the flaking was a recent phenomenon or developed over time. ""In any case, ASI should have been noticed the decay so that the inscriptions could have been saved in entirety,"" said an official. ASI is reported to be toying with the idea of a protective cover over the pillar. ""The option will be explored if the investigations point at environmental factors,"" said a source.

Is China's future-ready plan better?,The Times of India (TOI),1/27/2017,HEALTH NEWS,"Had the graded response action plan been in place in 2016, the city would have seen the odd-even scheme just five times over 19 days. Similarly , other ""emergency"" interventions, including a blanket ban on construction activities, would have scarcely been implemented.In contrast, if Beijing's system were to be implemented in Delhi, the red alert (most severe) would have covered 78 days in the year. This is because the Chinese city's system is far more stringent and mainly relies on smog forecasts, instead of actual recorded concentrations. This, according to some experts, helps Beijing prevent, or quickly tide over, very severe pollution episodes.Greenpeace's air quality campaigners recently analysed how Beijing and Delhi's alert systems would play out in 2016 using R Studio -an open source data analytics software. 
They sourced daily average PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) and PM10 (coarse pollution particles) data from CPCB for 2016.Delhi would have had 67 ""severe"" and 110 ""very poor"" days, as specified in the graded response action plan.While experts welcomed the graded response action plan, being enforced by the SC mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority in Delhi NCR, a lag of 48 hours in declaring ""emergency"" could reduce its impact and might allow the worst to pass before it came into force, they said.Lauri Myllyvirta, senior air pollution campaigner, said: ""A delay of 48 hours to initiate the response and, presumably at least 24 hours more before the measures start to have a significant impact, is an issue. As severe smog events take at least 48 hours to build up, the measures should be in effect at least two days before, not two days after the pollution levels peak."" On three out of five occasions, the response would only have been initiated after the worst peak had already passed, added Myllyvirta.In fact, based on the analysis, he suggested that emergency response could be maintained over the winter months continuously when pollution levels were high. ""If measures are relaxed as soon as PM levels fall from emergency to, say , severe, this can render the interventions ineffective.""Unlike Delhi where the high pollution months are clearly identifiable, in Beijing the levels are variable through the year. Beijing revised its alert system recently based on its experience of previous winters.Its system is entirely based on forecast or smog predictions now -for example, a red alert is issued as soon as air pollution forecasts show four continuous days of heavy pollution, of which two days may have severe pollution. The same method was followed last December when Beijing had a red alert for seven days. ""Most of China's city-level response plans use forecast or predicted pollution scenarios as criteria. To make a forecast reliable, China's ministry of environment protection and bureau of meteorology have been advancing the technical mechanism, including an emission inventory ,"" said Linsai Dong, climate and energy campaigner in Beijing.Beijing issued two red alerts each in 2015 and 2016, which according to its environmental bureau's analysis, reduced 30% of local emissions, added Linsai. ""Red alerts in 2016 have been sent in a more organised way -when the ministry of environment protection predicted that the re will be an severe and longlasting smog episodes in December, it sent pre-warnings to the municipalities, including Beijing, notifying the predicted air pollution episodes and encouraging red alerts,"" she said.A CPCB official told TOI, ""As of now, the plan is to introduce emergency response only when we have 48-hour emergency levels. People are worried about a November 2016-like smog episode when levels shoot through the roof. But we feel that was a one-off. We are also working on forecasts and have partnered IMD to make predictions robust.""He also said that the graded response action plan meant to prevent an emergency episode altogether.Delhi's action plan for ""severe"" air days involves closing brick kilns and hot-mix plants, intensifying use of public transport, introducing differential rates during off-peak hours and mechanised cleaning of roads. In ""very poor"" days, it mandates a ban on the use of diesel generator sets and imposing a hike in parking fee by three to four times.

Police officials of UP to greet rickshaw pullers and auto drivers 'Happy New Year',The Times of India (TOI),01-01-2017,AGRA,"AGRA: With a motto to start the new year on a positive note, all police officials including senior superintendent of police to inspector-level officers have been asked to wish a good year to the rickshaw pullers, auto drivers and sensitise them about traffic norms apart from turning them into good assets for information gathering. In an official letter written to all the officers of Uttar Pradesh police, DGP Javeed Ahmad has asked the officers to follow new practice from new year.Focusing on the menace of traffic jams, in the letter DGP has urged the police officials to conduct a meeting at police stations and greet the drivers of auto rickshaw, vans and rickshaw pullers on January 1, 2017 and create an awareness among them about traffic rules, such as avoiding over speeding, illegal parking, assuring safe journey for passengers and awarenewss about air pollution. 
DGP has asked his men to create cordial relationship with the auto drivers and rickshaw pullers in an attempt to turn them into good assets for information gathering. ""Make them eyes and ears of police,"" said DGP Ahmad. Mentioning about the two Kairana constables (Shahzad Ali and Dipanshu Tyagi) who nabbed Khalistani militant (Parwinder Singh Pinda) who escaped Nabha jail in the November month, DGP said, ""Due to alertness of our men, the Punjab fugitive was caught which added laurels to UP police, but at the same time our others officers were also criticised for misbehaving with civilians in various incidents. We as a one organisation have to work on bringing change in our behavior to deal with people and serve them with unbiasedness.""

"Patna, Delhi among most polluted cities: Report",The Times of India (TOI),2/20/2017,POLLUTION,"NEW DELHI: Air pollution is killing two people in India every minute, with the country's environment turning more toxic by the day, says a new study published in the journal 'The Lancet'. According to the study, some of the worst polluted cities of the world are in India. The study, released this week but based on 2010 data, estimates that, globally, 2.7-3.4 million preterm births may be associated with exposure to PM 2.5. South Asia, with 1.6 million preterm births, is the worst hit, the study addedThe review by 48 scientists and experts from 16 international institutions has warned that air pollution has adverse health effects on people even when the concentration of pollutants meets WHO standards. At the same time, it said reducing air pollution will lead to massive health benefits. 
The study, called 'The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change' - a review of significant scientific studies - refers to the recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report which had collated PM 2.5 exposure in lower, middle and upper income countries. In the report, Patna and Delhi figure among the most polluted cities, both having an annual PM 2.5 concentration of more than 120 micrograms per cubic metres - about 12 times the WHO guideline. The WHO annual PM 2.5 guideline is 10 micrograms per cubic metres. This IEA report had sourced data from the World Health Organisation (WHO's) urban air quality database of 2016. ""An estimated 18,000 people die every day because of exposure to ambient and household air pollution, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. Ambient air pollution is particularly pertinent in urban areas, but it also affects non-urban populations,"" the Lancet Countdown states.""About 80% of people living in urban areas around the world are exposed to air pollution levels in excess of WHO guidelines. This number rises to 98% for urban populations in low-income and middle-income countries,"" the countdown states. The report also adds that household air pollution that results from use of solid fuels and other biomass contributes to around 4.3 million deaths annually, which are related to pneumonia, stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The Lancet Countdown will report annually in The Lancet journal. The institutions involved in the project includes bodies such as University College London, Tsinghua University and the Centre for Climate & Security among others. They have collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) too. The report underlines that air pollution and climate change are related and addressing air pollution will have climate change benefits too.

MPCB issues notice to car service centre,The Times of India (TOI),3/14/2017,NAGPUR,"Nagpur: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has issued notice to a car dealership and its service centre on Ghat Road for violating environmental norms.Following a complaint filed by RTI activist Kamlesh Shah regarding unscientific disposal of waste water, the board officials recently conducted a on-the-spot inspection and found that the effluent treatment plant (ETP) was not operational.As per the inspection report, the service centre is violating the provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. Thought the car service centre has an ETP to treat waste water generated from the washing section, the effluent generated after washing the vehicles is being discharged outside the premises without any treatment. Apart from this, the centre did not provide any records related to generation and disposal of hazardous waste. ""Oil skimmer was also not provided to the ETP,"" the report said.Following this, the board has issued a showcause notice to the centre and directed the owner to send a reply within seven days. 
In case of non-compliance, the board can close the unit.""In his complaint, Shah has pointed out that contaminated water containing oil, grease and other pollutants is damaging the environment. ""Many car workshops in the city are not using ETPs. MPCB field officials should do regular monitoring of such units,"" Shah said, adding that at some places, waste water is being discharged into Nag river. ""Action should be taken as per section 33 of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974,"" he said. A senior board official said the waste water generated from the car washing section contains hazardous chemicals. ""When the water is released without treatment, it pollutes drainage as well as groundwater,"" the official said.Last year, after taking note of TOI's report on contamination of water at Shukla Nagar near Manewada ring road by a car service centre, MPCB had issued a notice to the owner and also instructed to set up an effluent treatment plant to treat waste water on his premises. The dirty water, containing oil, grease and other pollutants after servicing and car washing was being directly released into the main drainage line of the area. It had not just resulted in choking of the drainage pipeline but also caused internal seepage due to which the contaminated water had started entering the local wells of the residents.

50 illegal crusher units to be sealed,The Times of India (TOI),03-09-2017,BHUBANESWAR,"BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) on Tuesday made an additional list of 50 illegal crusher units in Khurda district to seal those. The units have violated pollution control norms. The pollution panel has set March 17 and 18 deadline to seal these units with the help of local administration. 
On January 30, the board sealed 22 unauthorised units. The district administration has been informed about the 50 units that will be shut, said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi. ""Like the 22 sealed units, the 50 crushers also didn't take site permission from the local administration. The crusher units come under our purview as they cause air pollution. The dust particles coming out of the units during processing is harmful to the nearby habitation. The units don't have the mandatory consent to operate certificate,"" he said.""We will physically seal the units in the presence of police and officials from the energy department. The electricity supply to the units will be discontinued,"" Panigrahi said.According to the site criteria, the units should be located at a minimum distance of 200 metres from the National Highway and State Highway. It should operate 500 metres away from the habitations.Pollution board sources said since the units are not located at the distance prescribed by the pollution board, dust concentration in the nearby habitation (within three km radius of crushers) was found to be nearly 1,000 micro gram per metre cube while the permissible limit is 600 micro gram. In another development, the seven stone quarries operating at Tangi in Khurda district, which were served show cause notice, have given in writing to the board not to use high-intensity explosives for blasting of stones. The board had issued advisory to use low-intensity explosives.

Prod for stench-free Howrah station,The Times of India (TOI),4/27/2017,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: The first thing that hits the nostrils after one alights from a premier train like the Rajdhani Express at Howrah station is the stench of uncleared sewerage. The station - touted as the Gateway to Kolkata - leaves a lot to be desired as far as cleanliness is concerned. Therefore, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued notices to Railway Board, Eastern Railway, South Eastern Railway and West Bengal Pollution Control Board, regarding cleanliness at one of the busiest stations in the country. 
Nearly 8.5 lakh passengers use the Howrah station every day.In an application to the NGT, environment activist Subhas Datta submitted 135 pairs of long-distance trains use the station everyday. Each of these trains have 15-18 passenger coaches. With four toilets in each coach, nearly 26,000 mobile toilets pass through the station every day.""Most coaches haven't been fitted with bio-toilets. People use the toilets even when the trains are on the platforms. Save for platform 9, used by premier trains like Rajdhani, none of the platforms are properly or regularly cleaned. Due to this, the entire stretches of the platforms emit a stench. Except for the the platform ends, the remaining portions are covered causing lack of air circulation. Passengers are subjected to severe air pollution for which the tracks should be washed every two hours. Gradually, all long-distance trains should be fitted with bio-toilets,"" Datta submitted before the bench of Justice S P Wangdi and expert member Ranjan Chatterjee.The activist added, the capacity of the sewerage treatment plant at the station needs to be enhanced. ""The plant was set up in 1995 after Supreme Court directions. The station had 16 platforms then. Now, there are 23 platforms.There are also seven eateries and restaurants within the station complex. These should seek consents to operate from the pollution control board. So should the Yatri Niwas at the New Complex. Solid waste, primarily plastic, collected from the coaches of trains that terminate at the stations and pantry cars are dumped beside the tracks at the Howrah rail yard. This should be stopped immediately,"" the applicant added. Based on the application, the NGT issued the notices and set the next date of hearing on May 23. The pollution board has been directed to inspect the station. Railway authorities have been directed to provide all assistance to the board.

"Dust chokes Gurgaon, greens blame it on construction",The Times of India (TOI),04-01-2017,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: The Millennium City remained the country's second most polluted city for 24 hours with Air Quality Index (AQI) reported at 337 between Wednesday and Thursday. The most polluted city was Gaya with AQI recorded at 352, while the third most polluted city was Lucknow with AQI level at 321. The AQI in Delhi, on the other hand, was recorded at 264. While officials blamed dust storm from Rajasthan for increase in the air pollution levels, activists blamed increase in construction activity. 
""North-westerly winds are bringing in dust storm from Rajasthan. That is why, an increase in fine particles (PM2.5) has been noticed, which led to an increase in AQI. Other pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide remained were well under prescribed standard,"" said an HSPCB (Haryana State Pollution Control Board) official.Experts blamed widespread construction activities arounds the national highways. ""Huge construction activity is going around national highway-8 and Golf Course Road. The construction activity not only increases dust pollution, but also traffic congestion. Green cover around the national highway has been destroyed. All these factors are making Gurgaon one of the most polluted city in the country,"" said Niranjan Raje, a member of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).

Km. land under waste disposal by 2050: Study,The Times of India (TOI),6/26/2017,INDIA,"MANGALURU: Considering the present scenario of waste management in India, where most of the waste is dumped without treatment, it would require an estimated 88 square kilometer (sq. km.) of precious land to be brought under waste disposal through landfilling by 2050, which is equivalent to the size of area under administration of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), noted a recent joint study by ASSOCHAM and PwC.""This will eventually render the land unfit for any other use for as long as a half century before it can be stabilised for other uses,"" said the report titled, 'Waste Management in India: Shifting Gears,' jointly conducted by ASSOCHAM and global consulting firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers).As such it is imperative to relook into present systems of waste management in the country, suggested the ASSOCHAM-PwC study.As per a previous estimate, by 2050 about 50 per cent of India's population will be living in urban areas, and the volume of waste generation will grow by 5% per year.Accordingly, the expected waste quantity we are looking at for the year 2021, 2031, and 2050 are 101 million metric tonnes (MMT) per year, 164 MMT, and 436 MMT per year respectively.The report noted that waste generation of Class I cities (with population between 0.1 million to five million) in India has been estimated to be around 80 per cent of country's total waste generation.Highlighting the concerns about per capita waste generation rate, the study said that presently it is about 300-400 gm/capita for medium cities and 400-600 gm/capita for large cities. 
""This is going to increase with the present trend of urbanisation and consumption patterns.""On the need for proper waste treatment to generate environmental and monetary benefits, the study said that poorly managed waste has direct implications to urban environment, leading to air, water, and soil pollution, together with long-term health impacts, while it has indirect implications to our economy and growth prospects.However, improper planning for waste management, complex institutional setup, constraints in capacity for waste management using modern techniques and best practices, and limited funds with urban local bodies (ULBs) are some of the reasons waste management in India has become an area of concern.It also said that though private sector can play a critical and greater role in waste management in India, there are a various issues and bottlenecks on different fronts that have made it challenging to successfully implement projects - policy and regulatory, financing, project conceptualisation and structuring, technology and capacity.The ASSOCHAM-PwC study has recommended the government to accord industry status to waste management sector to provide it necessary boost and regulatory adherence with dedicated monitoring and compliance cell.""

Committee to ask rlys to revise proposal on cutting 182 trees,The Times of India (TOI),7/18/2017,KOCHI,"Kochi: The tree cutting permit issuing committee visited the railway property in the buffer zone of Mangalavanam on Monday following the application of the Southern Railway seeking permission to cut down 182 trees on the zone.The team included assistant conservator of forests K J Martin Lowel, committee member Jacob Lazar and other forest officials. They found that there were a few rain trees which play a role in the ecosystem of the area. ""The railways has old three to four railways tracks on which several trees have grown. 
The railways want to develop the station for operations,"" said Lowel.He said that the tracks would need a complete re-haul as they were almost under mud. The committee later met Kochi corporation mayor Soumini Jain, who is the committee chairman, and decided to ask the railways to submit a revised proposal with a sketch of the actual trees that need to be cut.""There are many trees that can be trimmed. It needn't be cut down. So we have sought a detailed report of the actual number of trees that need to be cut down,"" said the ACF, who is the secretary of the committee.The committee members said that the railways had earlier planned to make it into a heritage station. ""One doesn't even know the advantage of having a railways station there,"" a member said.The railways had approached the committee a few weeks ago for getting clearance to develop the station, which is estimated to cost Rs 500 crore.Meanwhile, environmentalists also reached the spot to show their objection against the move of the railways.""The bird sanctuary is the oxygen cylinder for the highly air-polluted city. This land was initially suggested as a spot for planting trees as part of afforestation to compensate the tree loss due to construction of Kochi Metro,"" said C M Joy, president, Kerala nature protection forum.He said that nesting of migratory birds would be affected if trees are cut from the core zone of the sanctuary. ""The Mangalavanam ecosystem is slowly becoming stabilized now after it was disturbed following construction of CMFRI and Kerala high court. Now, again a disturbance to this pristine forest will be a great loss to many of the species,"" he added.

Crop burning: NGT raps govt for no action plan,The Times of India (TOI),08-09-2017,JAIPUR,"Jaipur: Rajasthan government has been pulled up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) after failing to submit action plans to prevent air pollution emanating from crop stubble burning after the harvesting season of Kharif crop.The tribunal on August 4 gave State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), final opportunity requiring them, at least, to file action plans with complete accountability and elements of performance, within one week. Next hearing is scheduled on August 11.Ultimatum came along with a warning that if SPCB failed to comply with the directions, NGT will be compelled to attach the treasury account of the state. That is state will have to pay up for the pollution caused from its own coffers.Apart from Rajasthan three other states - Haryana, UP and Punjab too have failed in giving the details to NGT.Earlier, the tribunal had also asked these states to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.However, officials of SPCB expressed their surprise over the orders and claim that report has already been submitted to the tribunal. 
They claimed that Rajasthan is a part of a committee constituted by the ministry of environment and presented all facts and figures before them.""We have already notified and banned any sort of crop burning activities in the state. The practice however is not much prevalent in Rajasthan barring few pockets of Kota and Sriganganagar"" said a senior official of RSPCB.For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane.It was observed that crop burning is a major contributor to Delhi's winter air-pollution. With parts of Rajasthan from Alwar and Bharatpur district falls under national capital region (NCR), Rajasthan too was asked to take preventive measures.

Phogat sisters teach value of waste segregation in South Delhi,The Times of India (TOI),09-01-2017,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: The brand ambassadors of South Delhi Municipal Corporation for sanitation Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat have taken up the job to teach residents the value of waste segregation and how it can make their areas cleaner. The popular sisters launched a campaign titled ""Let's Go Green and Blue"" in SDMC's west zone on Thursday to promote proper segregation of the waste to help in the disposal and re-use of waste through re-cycling process. From waste zone the campaign will be taken to other zones.Awareness about waste segregation is close to zero across the three corporations - it's the reason why Delhi has multiple rising mountains of air-polluting landfills on its outskirts. 
Delhi everyday generates around 9000 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste. Of this SDMC generates over 3000 tonnes of waste, largest among the three corporations. Whatever little consciousness about sorting of waste exists is confined to a couple of households only. Since they are unsegregated most of the municipal solid waste goes to landfill sites. The waste disposal machines are compatible to handle segregated waste only, but the residents do not know it.Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat made people including children gathered at a mall in Subash Nagar in South Delhi pledge that they will never mix wet and dry waste. ""You should concentrate on the segregation of waste, especially kitchen waste. Only after segregation the waste becomes useful and it can be recycled,"" said Geeta Phogat. ""After it is segregated, we can use the green waste to make compost while the dry waste can be recycled or used to generate electricity from waste. It is not possible when the waste is not segregated at the household level,"" said an official. Though rag pickers segregate some amount of waste to collect recyclable products from it, it is not possible to segregate dry and wet waste after it is mixed.Segregation of waste involves putting green waste like peels of fruits, vegetables, discarded foods in green bin and dry waste like food wrappers, wood, metals and glass in blue bins. In several developed countries regulations exist to force citizens to segregate waste since it is useful to keep the environment clean.SDMC is going to distribute two coloured bins in different societies. ""We have launched the campaign in west zone, it will soon be taken to other zones as well,"" said mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat.An important component of Swachh Bharat campaign waste segregation has got a major push in the country, but the three municipal corporations of Delhi have not given a great response to it. In public places it is hard to find separate bins for separate bins. Even in gated societies such bins are lacking and the residents' welfare associations have also not been effectively involved for it.

"Mangaluru celebrated Diwali eco-friendly way, reveals study",The Times of India (TOI),10/29/2017,MANGALURU,"Mangaluru: An air quality monitoring exercise done in Mangaluru before and during Diwali reveals that the city chose to celebrate the festival in an eco-friendly way.The four air quality monitoring stations set up by the Anti-Pollution Drive Foundation (APDF), a non-profit organization, in association with St Georges Homeopathy, across the city to monitor air quality before and during Diwali festival revealed that the overall air quality in the city did not deteriorate much during the festival. This comparative study conducted in association with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will be submitted to the district administration, Mangaluru City Corporation and other auhtorieis concerned. ""The study which was conducted in the residential areas shown that the overall air quality remained same during Diwali as it was before the festival. 
The APDF had earlier conducted a study on air pollution caused by vehicles. Smoke emitting vehicles and vehicular pollution, which is a bigger threat than fireworks, are still the major cause of concern. This Diwali several people in Mangalore took an informed decision to avoid bursting firecrackers as we are coming in terms with its hazardous effect on our health and the environment,"" said Abdullah A Rehman, founder, APDF.Under its 'Shuddha Gaali' project, APDF set up air quality assessment stations at Alvares Road in Kadri, Landlink in Konchadi, Pai Compound in Urwa Store and Kudroli Dwara. The assessment of air quality was done on October 16 to 19 from 6.30pm to 10.30pm. The sampling and data was collected by OneEarth Enviro Labs, who tested the air-quality and also compared it with the ambient air quality standards of India.Six outdoor air pollutants were measured to understand the impact of air pollution caused by fireworks on the environment. They were suspended particulate matter (SPM); PM10 (inhalable particles) and PM2.5 (fine inhalable particles). Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. The other pollutants are: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2); Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Lead, he added.

Panel to assess impact of Metro rail project on Mutha river bed,The Times of India (TOI),10/15/2017,PUNE,"PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) bench here on Friday constituted a multi-member team of experts under the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) for assessing the impact of the Pune Metro Rail construction work on the 1.7km stretch of the Mutha river bed.The bench of Justice U D Salvi and expert member Nagin Nanda directed Neeri as well as Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board to nominate senior scientists specialising in the fields of hydrology, ecology, biodiversity and water pollution on the expert committee. The panel will submit its report by next hearing on November 14.""The expert committee shall visit the site(s) of construction(s) of Metro Rail and proposed route and take photographs, collect samples and carry out local investigation as deemed necessary to assess impact of construction on ground water recharge, biodiversity in the river bed, free flow of the water, risk of flooding, debris disposal, water and air pollution and also mitigating factors involved therein,"" the bench said.""The expert committee shall study whether the impacts assessed by them individually or cumulatively are irreparable or not and make their recommendations, if any, in that regard,"" the bench said. While the MPCB has to provide all logistic support to the committee, the cost of this scientific investigation is to be borne jointly by the Pune Municipal Corporation and the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro). The PMC and MahaMetro have to make an initial deposit of Rs2.50 lakh with the MPCB for this purpose, the bench added.""The PMC has been directed to furnish copies of the development plan of Pune city and Metro Rail to the committee. 
Project consultant Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and project executioner MahaMetro have been directed to furnish detailed project report along with environmental assessment report, if any, to the expert committee,"" DMRC's lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni told TOI.Since May last year, the green tribunal has been hearing an application by architect Sarang Yadvadkar and others challenging the Metro Rail route alignment passing through the Mutha river bed stretch on the grounds that it will badly impact the eco-system of the river.Both, Yadvadkar and his lawyer Asim Sarode, said, ""In spite of strong opposition from MahaMetro and PMC, the NGT has constituted the panel. We welcome this ruling. The same will lead to a scientific study and rational evaluation of the impact of the project on Pune river.""

Will odd-even in Gurgaon work?,The Times of India (TOI),10-04-2017,GURGAON,"According to data released by the Central Pollution Control Board on Sunday, Gurgaon was ranked the most polluted city. Keeping Diwali in mind, which might make the air quality even worse, the Gurgaon administration has proposed to keep the odd-even scheme as an option to reduce air pollution in the city. While the administration is yet to take a decision on the implementation of the scheme, the residents of the Millennium City already stand divided on the issue. While some are open to the idea, others feel that this might only be a temporary solution. 
The dense smog that covered the city after Diwali last year (BCCL/ Ajay Kumar Gautam) 'The administration should come up with different measures to curb pollution' Adil Nargolwala, a resident of MG Road, says, ""Gurgaon has zero public transport and this might create chaos. What the administration needs to do is to ensure no or minimal use of fire crackers this year.""Adil adds, ""The administration should not give licences to the shops selling fire crackers. Schools should conduct programs to educate children and their parents. The Millennium City is full of condominium housing, they can also pass an administrative order making it illegal for residents to light crackers.""Taking a cue from Delhi's implementation of the car-rationing plan, the Gurgaon administration has kept the scheme as an option to reduce pollution levels. 'Not sure if gurgaon has sufficient traffic control to monitor this scheme'Paarkhi Mehrotra, a resident of sector 33, says, ""I would imagine more inconvenience because of the demand for cabs. Also, I am not sure if Gurgaon has sufficient traffic control to monitor this scheme. I definitely don't think that this will have an impact on pollution though, given the prevalence of heavy vehicles and construction sites in the city.""A Civil Defence volunteer offers red roses to an odd-even violator in Delhi last year 'It will help reduce pollution generated from vehicles'Gaurav Makkar, a resident of Sohna Road, says, ""It's an ambitious attempt and we should give it a try as it may not help to bring down the overall air pollution level but, it will help in reducing pollution through vehicles. The number of vehicles is far too high, the scheme will help with traffic congestion and hence lesser pollution from the vehicle spewing emissions in the air, which will help reduce air pollution. Also, Gurgaon has its own Rapid Metro, which is now extended till the Golf Course Extension Road, which is highly under utilised. The odd-even scheme can push people out of their comfort zone to use public transport."" 'Given last year's condition, how are we planning to control it this year?'Smriti Chhabra, a resident of Sector 56, asks, ""Last year, in the days after Diwali, we experienced dense smog across the region with extremely high pollution levels and unbreathable conditions. The authorities had put a ban on burning of waste and crop stubble and also a ban was imposed on fireworks. How are we planning to control it this year? Are fireworks going to be restricted?"" 'It didn't help Delhi, it won't help Gurgaon either'Vidya Deshpande, a resident of DLF Phase 3, says, ""Odd-even didn't help in Delhi, it won't help in Gurgaon either. We need real solutions, the need is to regulate the timings of construction sites (to reduce dust pollution); have more e-rickshaws on the road; improve urban connectivity with more buses and also encourage employers to use carpooling.""

"At this decibel rate, the city may soon go deaf",The Times of India (TOI),10/26/2017,JAIPUR,"Jaipur: It was not only air pollution that was alarmingly high in Jaipur during Diwali, but noise pollution too reached an all-time record in most zones in the city.The entire city was exposed to almost double the level of permitted decibel sound on October 19 during both day and night. The decibel levels measured by the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB) says that the worst-affected were silent zones-Civil Lines and Santokba Durlabji Hospital (SDM) zones. Both these zones registered 77.9 and 84.7 decibels, respectively, against the standard 40, says RPCB which released the report on Wednesday.The RPCB measures noise pollution at six zones with two each in silent, commercial and residential categories. While Civil Lines and SDM are silent zones, Mansarovar and Raja Park are in the commercial category, and Jawahar Nagar and Gandhi Nagar in the residential category.The Chauti Chaupar zone, which covers most of the Walled City area, has been omitted this year due to the ongoing construction of the Metro line.Noise pollution levels have risen from previous years, exposing the slew of efforts claimed by different agencies of the state to reduce the same. 
Firecrackers have been blamed for high decibel levels along with loud music played at several places on Diwali. RPCB officials, however, claimed that the noise pollution was not restricted to Diwali, Ganpati festival or Muharram. ""It's becoming a daily affair,"" says a RPCB official.Dr Tarun Ojha, ENT head of a private medical college in the city, said, ""I received at least seven cases during Diwali facing difficulties in hearing due to acoustic trauma caused by loud sound of crackers. Two of them have suffered from sensorineural hearing loss. Now, it's difficult for them to recover. Exposure to sudden single sound of more than 140 decibels causes damages to ear drums. If it damages the cochlear, then it's not possible to repair the same.""The high decibel sound in silent zones is a cause of concern, feel experts. It goes on unabated despite laws in place under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. It clearly states that, ""no horn shall be used in silent zones or during night time in residential areas except during a public emergency"". Hospitals, schools and verified government buildings fall under the category of silent zones. It also has the provision to prosecute offenders. A complaint can be filed at the police station.The rules also define the role of state as a competent body to take, ""measures for abatement of noise, including noise emanating from vehicular movements, blowing of horns, bursting of sound emitting firecrackers, use of loudspeakers or public address system and sound producing instruments and ensure that the existing noise levels do not exceed the ambient air quality standards specified"". Several reports have estimated that almost 6% Indians suffer from hearing loss. It also says that the continuous exposure of noise above 60 decibels is harmful not only for hearing but also causes serious health problems-deafness, sleep disorders, etc.As per a report, one kg of crackers burns 2kg of oxygen to release toxic gases. These include nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, CO2 and heavy metal oxides. ""These are harmful and can aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, COPD, etc., even in healthy persons. Cracker fumes are dangerous for the old. During the last 3-4 days, I have across dozens of patients whose respiratory condition have worsened with cracker pollution,"" says Dr Virendra Singh, former superintendent and respiratory diseases specialist, Sawai Man Singh Hospital.What made the situation worse is the high air pollution level of 496 index value, measured in 'Particle Matter 10' (particles smaller than 10 microns), recorded in VKIA area followed by the densely-polluted Chandpole area with an index value of 483 PM10, as per figures released by the pollution control board.Times ViewJaipur is quickly progressing towards becoming a 'noisy city'. Both the administration and civil society, the two main stakeholders, have been callous and turned a blind eye to the rising noise pollution which is gradually turning into a health hazard. The administration can take a slew of measures under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 and prosecute offenders. But action has been selective or rare. In the absence of awareness drives, the civil society tolerates noise pollution of all sorts from their backyard to the roads. The state has to take the citizens along and launch mass awareness campaigns to fight the menace. The figures released by the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB), which shows all the six zones of having registered high decibel levels, are ominous for the city.

MPCB to seek ban on two ear-splitting firecrackers,The Times of India (TOI),10-05-2017,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: Following a pre-Diwali test of firecrackers, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB) intends to recommend that the controller of explosives, Nagpur, ban at least two for violating noise limits set by the state. On Wednesday, MPCB along with NGO Awaaz Foundation tested 23 firecrackers for noise levels at an open ground in Royal Chemical Fertiliser (RCF) Colony, Chembur. A total of 25 crackers will also be tested for chemical analysis.Tests showed that noise levels produced by crackers were higher than in the previous year when MPCB hadn't found the need to recommend any ban. 
Officials said they had also seen a rise in air pollution among noiseless crackers.Among series crackers, the loudest was 119dB while that in single bomb created 119.6dB against the 125dB limit. A series of 10,000 crackers recorded a maximum noise of 112.6dB- much higher than the 105dB limit. Last year's noisiest were 99.9 dB and 116.2dB, respectively.V M Motghare, joint director, MPCB, said the items are single Dyno Bomb and a 10,000 series cracker. ""Most single bombs recorded levels very close to permissible levels and were much louder than last year. The final report, including chemical analysis, will be ready by October 12."" Similar tests are being conducted in the state. MPCB will deploy squads in 27 municipal corporations to check sale of banned crackers. S C Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB, said, ""Citizens must avoid buying less noisy but smoke crackers as well."" Awaaz Foundation's Suraiya Artes said, ""These tests are done on an open ground but the effects get amplified in the city's environment. While there has been a decline in the use of crackers in the past few years, a lot still needs to be done.""

"Air pollution worries Chennai, but grasp of subject poor: Survey",The Times of India (TOI),11-11-2017,CHENNAI,"CHENNAI: City residents are concerned about the air they breathe, but their understanding of air quality and pollution is poor, shows a recent survey .The survey titled ` A hazy view' gauged public awareness, perceptions and attitudes towards air quality in 11 Indian cities. Chennai residents fared poorly on knowledge of health hazards of pollution as well.But they claimed to know more. While 72% of respondents from Chennai said they were aware of air pollution, 61% said they understood air quality index (AQI). About 40% of the residents rated the quality of city air as very poor, though the Central Pollution Control Board readings show Chennai in the green zone. 
City residents, however, were found to be curious when it came to air quality, according to the survey: 63% seek information on the issue frequently.Despite 38% of Chennai re spondents claiming awareness of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, only 16% of those surveyed correctly identified PM as the greatest health hazard. A ccording to 93% of city respondents, vehicular pollution is the signifi cant cause of air pollution; 71% blamed burning of waste.As for actions taken by the government to tackle air pollution, 56% were unhappy .Carpooling was favored by 69% of respondents who favoured less use of private vehicles, 62% wanted a ban on open burning of garbage.At the national level, while a majority of respondents claimed awareness about air pollution (81% claimed to be extremely aware or very aware) and air quality index (66%), a majority of respondents (57%) rated air quality as acceptable or better.While 49% of respondents claimed awareness about PM 2.5, only 14% rated PM as a pollutant of most concern. In addition, only 31% of the respondents linked air pollution with serious respiratory ailments like asthma.Edelman India conducted the survey for Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation. The foundation's senior programme manager for climate policy Kunal Sharma said: ""Public participation is key to improving air quality . For this, it is necessary to get a sense of the priorities and current levels of awareness so that public engagement can be better defined and implemented. This survey provides an initial assessment that can form the base for further studies.""

Aurangabad among state's 17 most polluted cities,The Times of India (TOI),11/24/2017,AURANGABAD,"Aurangabad: Aurangabad has earned the dubious distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in Maharashtra, with its air quality deteriorating by the day, thanks to unplanned growth, rising number of vehicles and absence of action plan. Moreover, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has found as many as 17 cities in the state, maximum in the country, including Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik besides Aurangabad, violating the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). A total of 94 cities from 22 states have figured in the list prepared based on the air quality data obtained over a five-year period (2011 to 2015) under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme. The list also has Jalna and Latur from Marathwada.All the listed cities have recorded higher levels of particulate matter with less than 10 \xB5m diameter (PM10) while some of them have recorded high concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2).Following the CPCB's directives, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has asked the municipal bodies in the listed cities to prepare action plans. 
Thus far, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Amravati, Navi Mumbai and Ulhasnagar municipal bodies have submitted reports. The other cities are expected to file their reports soon. Aurangabad-based Geetanjali Kaushik, an air quality expert who is preparing a report as per MPCB and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) guidelines for Aurangabad, Latur and Jalna, told TOI that it is crucial for smaller cities to work on an action plan before it is too late. ""Improving public transport, increasing the number of pollution under control (PUC) centres and CNG pumps, facilitating parking space for autos and taxis, use of bio-diesel and social campaigns are the key measures that cities can take to keep the PM10 levels under control,"" she said.Associate professor at the city-based Jawaharlal Nehru Engineering College Arvind Chel said the unplanned growth of metro cities has led to a huge problem in terms of maintaining air quality. ""Smaller cities are also growing in the same way. It is imperative to act now so that we can keep the situation under control."" In the 'Clean Air Maharashtra Resolve 2022' organised by NEERI, MPCB and IIT-Bombay in August this year, air pollution in the state was discussed and a decision to ask cities to prepare an action plan taken.

Agencies dragged feet on graded response: Experts,The Times of India (TOI),11-09-2017,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: An analysis by independent researchers suggests that even more stringent action could have been taken under the graded response action plan, but absence of those steps led to a gradual fall in air quality to ""emergency"" levels.Aishwarya Sudhir, an air pollution researcher who analysed AQI levels over the last one month, said: ""Air quality in Delhi began to sharply dip from moderate to poor category in the first week of October and continued to plunge into poor, very poor and severe categories before reaching the emergency situation."" The implementation of GRAP, however, started around October 18. ""The ministry of environment, forests and climate change notified the action plan for implementation on January 12. It has been close to 10 months since then, with a nodal agency, EPCA, to implement it. However, the notification for reasons unknown has come into effect from October 18 only,"" Sudhir said.Stressing that the current air pollution spike could have been averted if GRAP was implemented earlier and more stringently, she said GRAP had an ambitious set of measures under each category of alerts to be issued with action and implementation ranging from penalising the polluting car owners to capping of emissions from power plants across Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. 
""Most of these actions require coordinated efforts from various agencies and bodies spread across the NCR states to successfully implement any of the classified alerts. There is little or no evidence of a mitigation plan for addressing crop fires across the NCR states, the evidence is clearly attributing a 25% rise in the pollution levels to crop fires, yet, there's no mention of addressing these issues under the classified alert system given in GRAP,"" the analysis added.""The government and the environment ministry woke up to the awaiting air quality crisis only during the Under-17 FIFA World Cup scheduled to be hosted across cities. The government had enough time to implement GRAP and systematically issue health advisories as per the action plan guidelines; however, the effort to create public awareness and alert the citizens to safeguard their health only happened after reaching an emergency situation,"" it said.

"Vehicles emit smoke, thumb nose at police",The Times of India (TOI),11/16/2017,PATNA,"PATNA: Ever stranded on a bike in a traffic snarl right behind the omnipresent yellow city bus in Patna? You end up gasping for breath as your face gets covered with the thick black smoke emitted by the bus.Transport and police officials estimate at least 60% of the public transport vehicles being run by private players in Patna pose health hazards to the residents and cause air pollution. Worse, they add, they cannot act against them as they are armed with PUC (pollution under control) certificates, albeit bogus ones procured from private agencies. 
The number of such vehicles plying in the city is in thousands. From the financial years 2012-13 till October this year alone, according to the transport department, at least 18,797 autos and 5,649 buses were registered to ply in the state capital.""Once I stopped a bus emitting thick, black smoke near Gandhi Maidan, but the driver flaunted the PUC paper and I had to let him go,"" a police officer told TOI on Wednesday.Such vehicles have a valid permit issued by the transport department to ply on the city roads provided they possess other legal documents, including the PUC which is issued after the vehicle passes a test to check that its emissions meet the pollution control standards. A PUC certificate is a mandatory document requirement for a vehicle under the Central Motor Vehicle Rule, 1989, sources said.There are in the city around 20 to 25 outlets which have been authorised by the transport department to issue PUC certificates after proper tests. However, it is an open secret that most of them issue the certificates without conducting any test - on payment of a premium.""We do not have adequate wherewithal to expose the 'fakism',"" a senior traffic police officer said, explaining the city's traffic police have just one equipment that can record the harmful emissions of vehicles.Environmentalist Ashok Ghosh said carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide along with other hydrocarbons adversely affect the environment and health. Vehicles using inferior quality fuel and fuel mixed with kerosene only aggravate the situation.""Asthmatic or allergic people should strictly avoid standing near such vehicles. Even a healthy person may fall sick if exposed to their emissions,"" Ghosh said.Plying of vehicles older than 15 years has been banned by the Supreme Court. Even the Bihar government announced a ban the 15-year-old vehicles after CM Nitish Kumar chaired a review meeting of state environment department in June last year. Soon thereafter, the Patna district administration launched a drive to seize such vehicles. With passage of time, however, the ban is now left to remain on paper.

Seize overage vehicles to curb pollution: Admin to traffic cops,The Times of India (TOI),11/14/2017,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: The district administration on Sunday imposed intensive measures on Gurgaon to bring down pollution, following national green tribunal (NGT) guidelines. For starters, it has instructed police to seize any overage vehicle. There are 17,772 vehicles registered in Gurgaon that are over-aged. 
The administration has sent district traffic police a comprehensive list of 17,739 diesel and 33 petrol vehicles registered in Gurgaon that have exceeded the NGT prescribed age - 10 years for diesel and 15 for petrol.The list includes diesel vehicles registered under series HR 26, HR 26A to Q, HR 26R 0001 to 3411, ie, vehicles registered till November 8, 2011. Most of them are commercial vehicles. The oldest one, a tempo, was registered in December 1999, and had a fitness certificate till April 2014.For petrol vehicles, the series which are older than 15 years are HR 26, HR 26A to Z, HR 26AA to 26AM, HR 26AN 0001 to 3675. The petrol vehicles include six goods carriers, three ambulances and 24 cars. The oldest petrol vehicle, a Maruti Omni van, was registered as an ambulance in March 2002. Some of these also include those that have fitness certificates and have paid advance transport tax. However, in compliance with NGT guidelines, traffic police has been ordered to seize even these vehicles.""Some owners have retained their previous registration numbers after buying new vehicles during this tenure. So we have asked traffic police to check the registration certificate of suspect vehicles as a precautionary measure, before seizing them,"" said Vinay Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner, Gurgaon.The deputy commissioner has also ordered traffic police ""... for strict vigilance and no tolerance of visibly polluting vehicles, along with strict enforcement of pollution under control (PUC) norms"". So far this year, 15,808 vehicles have been challaned in Gurgaon for emitting thick smoke and not having a valid PUC certificate, while another 370 were challaned for not carrying sand, husk and other particles which pollute the air, uncovered. The corresponding figures of vehicles challaned by traffic police in 2016 are: 19,689 polluting vehicles, 252 uncovered vehicles; and for 2015: 7,208 polluting vehicles and 743 uncovered vehicles. The figures hint at the fact that monetary penalty has failed to discourage people from using polluting vehicles. Moreover, the number of vehicles in the city continue to rise. Since April 1 this year, 72,582 private vehicles have been registered in Gurgaon. Of these, only 970 are CNG cars. In the financial year 2016-17, Gurgaon saw 1,22,216 private vehicles getting registered, of which 1,441 were CNG. The corresponding figures for the financial year 2015-16 are: 1,09,739 vehicles registered, of which 1,292 were CNG.A further two lakh vehicles enter Gurgaon from surrounding districts, adding to its already high pollution level.

Villagers grow flowers to ward off stench,The Times of India (TOI),12-07-2017,VARANASI,"VARANASI: A village on the outskirts of Varanasi, Dinapur, has been growing flowers as an antidote to air pollution. Varanasi was declared the most polluted city of the country on November 10 with an alarming AQI of 491 by the Central Pollution Control Board. The natives of Dinapur village in Chiraigaon block started growing different varieties of flowers after the commissioning of a sewage treatment plant there in 1986. The fragrance of flowers overcomes the stench of sewage emanating from the STP. 
It also helps the villagers financially. ""About 99% households grow flowers to earn living. ""Mala aur phool bech kar ghar ka ration kharidte hain (We purchase our ration by selling garlands and flowers),"" village head Lalji Maurya said. Spread in area of 5 sq km, the village has a population of over 12,000. Earlier, most villagers used to grow vegetables, but today flower cultivation is the main occupation. ""We shifted to flower farming after 1985 as our vegetable crops were destroyed by animals particularly the Nilgai (blue bull). Besides, the work of sewage treatment plant was also started at that time. Today, the flower cultivation supports us financially and also saves us from the foul smell of sewage from the STP,"" former kshetra panchayat member Mangala Yadav said. The 80mld STP was commissioned in Dinapur during the first phase of Ganga Action Plan that was launched in 1985. Another STP of 140mld is under construction and expected to be completed by the end of the year. After completion of new STP, 220mld sewage will be treated in Dinapur, thus adding more stench to the environment in the village. One can see the flower plants in the village fields and women making garlands in almost all households. Dinapur is the biggest supplier of flowers in this area. ""About 50,000 floral garlands are supplied to flower mandi daily from our village,"" Yadav added. There is great demand of flowers in festive season and social functions and also political events during election time, he said. They have bear losses when there is bumper crop and low demand. ""There is no other option but to throw the unsold flowers particularly marigold,"" he said. Flowers like rose are used in other purposes like making gulab jal and essence. ""Garland making is a family business involving women and children whenever they find time ,"" said Shanti Devi, a middle age woman . Other family members also said that they enjoyed making garlands. For an outsider, it is plsant to see the flowers of different hues adding extra beauty to the greenery of the village. According to the gram pradhan, flowers like rose, arhul (hibiscus), chalemi (jasmine), marigold, gladiolus and others are cultivated in the village. Women make garlands. It is the duty of men to sell them in flower market in the city, he added. ""Trees play a major rolein absorbing pollutants"", said environment scientist BD Tripathi .

"Latur submits air quality action plan, Jalna to follow",The Times of India (TOI),12/16/2017,AURANGABAD,"Aurangabad: Latur Municipal Corporation has submitted the draft action plan on air quality to Latur Municipal Corporation to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) officials.Latur had figured among the list of 17 most polluted cities in the state after a five-year monitoring study conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) following which it was asked to submit a detailed action plan on air quality earlier this year. The action plan was submitted on December 13.The cities in the state that had recorded PM10 levels higher than the national standards from 2011 to 2015 included Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Navi Mumbai and Aurangabad, having more than a million population.Municipal corporations of Nagpur, Chandrapur, Amravati, Navi Mumbai and Ulhasnagar had already submitted their action plans. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) submitted its draft action plan on November 29. Jalna, which has also been found to be violating air quality standards, is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.In its action plan to improve air quality (AQ), the Latur Municipal Corporation (LMC) has categorically found out that it has only 3 AQ monitoring stations and no continuous monitoring station.The city was also found to be lacking in display boards and poor roads. 
The most worrying fact that emerged in the report was the miserably low forest cover in the city.""In Latur, only 0.35 per cent area is under forest. It is therefore imperative to develop a green belt in and around the city. The action plan suggests tree plantation beside roads and development of green traffic islands at crowded intersections sponsored by industries,"" air quality expert Geetanjali Kaushik, who prepared the action plan for LMC, said.She added that with 0.63 per cent forest cover, greening should be the top priority of Jalna.The action plans calls for more monitoring stations within the city in commercial, industrial and sensitive areas, installation of display boards providing air quality information to public, completion of emission inventory and source apportionment studies to highlight the sources of pollution and their respective contribution to the city's air quality, public awareness campaigns for air pollution control, vehicle maintenance and minimising use of personal vehicles, prevention of vehicle parking in congested areas, improvement of roads and promotion, use of biodiesel in vehicles and gensets, penalty on biomass and garbage burning and provision of more city buses.Kaushik submitted the draft action plan to MPCB field officer Pankaj Bawne at a meeting held in Latur in presence of LMC commissioner Achyut Hange and assistant commissioner Trimbak Kamble. The civic body is expected to begin implementation of its action plan to improve air quality. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Centre okays project to fight stubble burning in north India,The Times of India (TOI),12/30/2017,CHANDIGARH,"New Delhi: Seeking to address the issue of stubble burning in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, the environment ministry has approved launching of a regional project to tackle the menace that adversely affects air quality and soil health. The project will be implemented in a phased manner under the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC).The first phase of the project, costing approximately Rs 100 crore, was approved on Thursday for Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Initially, awareness generation and capacity building activities will be undertaken to encourage farmers to adopt alternate practices which would also help diversify livelihood options and enhance farmers' income.""Based upon the performance in the first phase, the scope could be enhanced and more activities can be supported subsequently"", said Union environment secretary C K Mishra who chaired the meeting of the National Steering Committee on Climate Change that approved the project. ""The project not only aims to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance adaptive capacity, but will also counter the adverse environmental impacts that arise from (stubble) burning"", said the environment ministry in a statement.It said, ""A slew of technological interventions will be undertaken for timely management of crop residue in addition to effective utilisation of existing machineries. 
Implementable and sustainable entrepreneurship models will be created in rural areas through upscaling successful initiatives and innovative ideas.""The problem of crop residue burning has been intensifying over the years with Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh being the major stubble burning hotspots. These activities affects air quality in Delhi and national capital region (NCR) every post-harvest season. Increased mechanisation, declining number of livestock and absence of economically viable alternative to use crop residue are some of the reasons why farmers resort to stubble burning.An official said that the regional project to deal with the issue of stubble burning under the NAFCC would be in addition to what the high-level central task force has planned as part of its 12-point action agenda for abatement of air pollution in Delhi and NCR. Pitching for coordinated action to combat stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP, the task force has already asked secretaries of agriculture and rural development to implement the agreed plan for managing crop stubble.It also asked the ministry to collaborate with the department of science & technology to ensure that independent data on stubble burning is available in real time for timely action.

HC moved against rickshaw ban on riverfront,The Times of India (TOI),12/14/2017,AHMEDABAD,"Ahmedabad: The city's autorickshaw drivers on Tuesday approached the Gujarat high court questioning the prohibition imposed on plying their vehicles on the Sabarmati riverfront roads, on either bank of the river.They have argued that when authorities can permit cabs to play on the riverfront roads, they must allow autorickshaws.The petitioners challenged the notification issued by the city police commissioner last year banning auto rickshaws on the riverfront to reduce traffic and curb air pollution in the gardens made for tourists and to ensure safety of visitors.The petition filed through advocate S H Iyer says that autorickshaw owners were forced to switch to CNG more than a decade ago to reduce pollution. The petition reads, ""Shockingly, the authority has not banned petrol and diesel cabs and taxis. 
Cabs and taxis are also commercial vehicles like that of the petitioners. There is absolutely no rationale or justification to permit petrol or diesel cabs, taxis, jeeps etc and imposing a ban on CNG-run autorickshaws which otherwise also do not cause any pollution.""The petitioners contended that the notification is a violation of constitutional provisions because it is arbitrary and discriminatory.The petitioners have stated that they had objected to the prohibitory orders but their representation was not responded to. They thought the ban on rickshaws would be temporary but the arrangement still exists. They have urged the HC to strike down the notification and direct the authorities to permit autorickshaws on the riverfront roads.The petition is likely to be heard on Wednesday.

"Air pollution can damage a child's brain forever, says Unicef",The Times of India (TOI),12-07-2017,HEALTH NEWS,"The link between air pollution and respiratory diseases is well-established, but the United Nations Children's Fund, in a report on Tuesday, said there is a growing body of scientific research which shows that air pollution can permanently damage a child's brain.The findings come at a time when India, particularly in the north, is facing a serious crisis due to rising levels of pollution. Last month, Delhi schools had to be shut temporarily to reduce children's exposure to pollutants that had enveloped the capital.The Unicef report also said that South Asia had the largest proportion of babies living in areas where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits (10 micrograms per cubic metre).The Unicef report, titled ""Danger in the air"", explains that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matters can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier - a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances.Second, exposure to specific air pollutant particles, such as magnetite, can lead to oxidative stress which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Quoting multiple studies, the UN body said polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in areas of high automobile traffic contribute to a loss of or damage to white matter in the brain. White matter is important for continued learning and development. ""Pollutants can permanently damage their developing brains,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said.The latest analysis of multiple researches states that pollutants can cross the placenta and affect the developing brain of a foetus. ""A young child's brain is especially vulnerable because it can be damaged by a smaller dose of toxic chemicals. Children are also highly vulnerable to air pollution because their physical defences and immunities are not fully developed', Unicef said.It advised parents to reduce children's exposure to pollutants by making it feasible for them to travel during times of the day when air pollution is lower.

Protest over garbage dumping at Sewage Farm could mess up city,The Times of India (TOI),12/15/2017,MYSURU,"Mysuru: The tourist hub is inching towards trouble over garbage management, even as Mysuru City Corporation readies for the annual sanitation survey of Indian cities by the Union government.Former BJP minister S A Ramdas will launch an indefinite agitation from Thursday at Vidyaranyapuram, seeking that MCC stops dumping of garbage at the solid waste management plant located at Sewage Farm in the area, and also to shift the plant outside the populated area.Spread over 100 acres, the Sewage Farm is used to dump garbage, while the plant is set up in a corner.Meanwhile, Krishnaraja MLA M K Somashekar, who has come under pressure over pollution in the area, accused Ramdas of trying to create trouble to garner votes.While the issue is taking a political turn, if agitators demand curbs on dumping of garbage at the Sewage Farm, the city could end up in a mess, given that the plant at Vidyaranyapuram is the sole facility in the city to process garbage daily.Days after Mysuru MP Prathap Simha visited the plant and complained against a foul smell and took objection to dumping of garbage at the site, MCC on Wednesday took remedial measures and started spraying chemicals to cut down air pollution, owing to dumping of garbage.Ramdas told reporters: ""Not just residents of Vidyaranyapuram, but even the public in seven wards in its surroundings are affected by the plant. It is because garbage is dumped at the site, leading to pollution."" 
He said the city generates 450 tonnes of garbage daily, while the plant processes 150 tonnes per day, and the remaining waste is dumped at the site. He said the government has failed to attend to the problem as it has not set up additional plants, as planned.He said he has asked residents and schools in the vicinity to extend support as it is affecting their lives. He asked the government to initially cut down dumping of garbage, and later shift the plant out of the populated area.However, Somashekhar launched a scathing attack on Ramdas and the Mysuru MP, and dubbed the agitation as mere theatrics. ""When Ramdas represented Krishnaraja segment, he served as minister, but he did nothing about cutting down pressure on the solid waste management plant or the stench which the residents complained about. Now he is putting on an act by pretending to be concerned about the people,"" he told reporters. He claimed there was a reduction in the waste managed at the plant after he was elected, and at least 100 tonnes is now processed at the zero-waste management plants set up in the city, while 47 tonnes of dry waste is collected separately.He added: ""I will find a permanent solution to the garbage problem at the plant as we will float a tender to set up a waste plant that generates electricity. We have obtained permission from the government to set up a 150-tonne capacity plant at Rayanakere and a 200-tonne capacity plant at Kesare.""

"Warmest Jan 16 in last 5 years, air quality improves",The Times of India (TOI),1/17/2018,DELHI,"New Delhi: The mercury touched 25.5 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, making it the warmest January 16 that the capital has seen in the last five years. The maximum was six degrees above normal for the season and the minimum was recorded at 9.1 degrees-two notches above normal. The maximum temperature may rise further in the next few days, met officials said. 
Delhi last saw a warmer January 16 in 2012 when it recorded a maximum temperature of 25.6 degrees Celsius. The rise in temperatures also helped Delhi's air quality improve, with pollution levels coming down to 'poor' from 'very poor' on Monday. On Tuesday, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 256-a sharp drop from 330 on Monday, making it the cleanest day in terms of air quality this week.Officials from Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) said temperatures are expected to stay above normal for the next 5-6 days, with winds carrying a westerly component. ""The wind direction may soon change, raising the temperature to around 26 degrees. This is warmer than normal as maximum for January should be around 20 degrees Celsius,"" said an RWFC scientist.Most locations across the capital recorded a maximum of over 24 degrees, with the Ridge area touching 25.5, Lodhi road 25.3 and Ayanagar recording a maximum of 25.2 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the humidity levels were between 35% and 83%.Data from CPCB's central control room showed both PM2.5 and PM10 levels falling to around two times the safe standard, with wind speed increasing on Tuesday. The average PM2.5 levels were recorded at 121 micrograms per cubic metre at 9pm on Tuesday, while the average PM10 levels were around 236 micrograms per cubic metre.

Pollution control board recommends hefty fines on construction sites for air pollution,The Times of India (TOI),01-12-2018,NOIDA,"GHAZIABAD: The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has recommended that GMC impose penalties on several building material suppliers for violating air pollution prevention norms. Penalties of Rs 50,000 each have been recommended for eight building material suppliers in a list sent to the municipal corporation on January 8 in accordance with directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).The board also recommended penalties of Rs 5 lakh each to be imposed on two real estate development projects in Vasundhara as per NGT norms. The UP Housing & Development Board has been asked to impose the penalties on these projects.The total quantum of penalties due from all 10 violators is Rs 14 lakh.UPPCB regional officer Ashok Tiwari told TOI, ""The list was compiled after conducting massive spot inspections throughout the district. 
It was found that the major source of air pollution in Ghaziabad pertains to construction activities. Major industries in the district have also been directed to undertake regular sprinkling of roads and open areas around their premises at their own expenses. We have subsequently identified around half-a-dozen other construction sites. Their penalties will be to the tune of Rs 6 lakh. This list will also be sent for necessary action.""Ghaziabad had recently been placed at the top in the list of most polluted cities in the country, owing to poor air quality index. GMC officials said the civic body is gearing up to tackle construction-related air pollution.""We have formed teams of officials. A plan of action is being chalked out. The GMC will extract penalties from violators in accordance with the pollution control board recommendations,"" municipal commissioner Chandra Prakash Singh told TOI.The penalties have been issued upon directions issued by NGT in December 2015 in the air pollution case of Vardhman Kaushik versus Union of India & Others.

Pollution-eating trees can cleanse city's air,The Times of India (TOI),1/16/2018,CHENNAI,"ed:sajuCoimbatore: Many of us romanticise the city weather by calling the haze in early morning and night hours mist or fog. But, the right word for it is smog-a mix of fog and a layer of polluted air-said researchers at the the Forest College and Research Institute at Mettupalayam, who have also found a solution to the malady-trees.""The situation in the city is becoming worse due to vehicular and industrial pollution,"" said Prasanthrajan, an associate professor of Silviculture. ""For the last two years, we have been collecting pollution levels at various locations in the city using a mobile ambient air quality monitor. 
For every pollutant, we have also found specific varieties of trees that could be planted,"" he told TOI.It has been scientifically proven that trees absorb pollutants and are the best bet against them, said A Balasubramanian, professor and head of the Silviculture department. ""We have prepared a detailed proposal that includes a list of trees that can be planted for specific pollutants present at various locations in the city. We plan to tie up with the city corporation and plant the saplings under the smart city project,"" he said.The researchers said that while trees use carbon-dioxide for photosynthesis, they also absorb other pollutants. ""If we plant them at highly polluted locations, we can help reduce pollutant levels in the area,"" said Prasanthrajan. ""We conducted tests at the forest college campus and found that the trees successfully reduce pollutants. We will make recommendations to the civic body for these specific varieties to be planted along roads,"" he said.Meanwhile, corporation officials said they also plan an extensive plantation drive in reserve sites to improve air quality. ""The city's climate has changed in the last few decades. To bring it back, bio-remedies are the best bet,"" said an official.The researchers also used data from the 30 air quality monitors in the city, corporation officials said. ""The researchers are working our various bio-remedies for water and air pollution inside the city limits. They are also developing pollutant resistant trees that could be planted on the lake bund,"" an official added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"As haze spreads, air in Mumbai worse than Delhi's",The Times of India (TOI),02-09-2018,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: For yet another day, haze continued to envelop many parts of the city as pollution levels rose marginally. On Wednesday, an average air quality index (AQI) of 275 was recorded, compared to 271 a day ago. An AQI of between 201 and 300 is considered poor, meaning such air could be harmful to sensitive people.The day's air quality was worse than in Delhi, which recorded an AQI of 211. Delhi's AQI was a significant improvement over the previous day, when it was in the very poor category. 
Meanwhile, minimum temperatures in Mumbai rose.While Mumbai's overall AQI was 275 (which falls in the poor category), among the 10 specific locations monitored by Safar in the city, six recorded an AQI in the very poor category (between 301 and 400). These were Mazgaon (342), Bhandup (327), Bandra Kurla Complex (327), Borivli (319), and Colaba (320). Navi Mumbai's AQI too was similar-309.As for temperatures, at the IMD's Colaba observatory, the minimum recorded was 23 degrees Celsius, compared to 21.5 degrees a day before. At Santacruz, the comparative readings were 21.5 and 19 degrees. Humidity levels recorded at Colaba and Santacruz were 80% and 51%. Explaining the rise in minimum temperatures in Mumbai, IMD scientist Ajay Kumar said, ""Winds are easterly to north easterly in the night, which bring in warm air. Owing to this, temperatures are on the rise. Besides, there is a westerly trough, which is moving northwest of the country. This is pulling in a lot of moisture from the Arabian Sea.""The city's AQI, measured by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), dipped owing to a spike in pollution. Marine Drive resident Mahendra Hemdev, who travelled widely during the day, said haze was spread across the city. ""I was in Bandra and then in the evening came towards south Mumbai and noticed that the haze was everywhere. It was difficult to see things at a distance. The weather has been very gloomy and if felt that it would rain too at some point. The kind of weather Mumbai has been witnessing has not brought any respite from heat,"" he said.Officials from Safar said air quality will improve from Friday. Dr Gufran Beig, project director, Safar, said, ""While the air is in the poor category now, we are expecting the same to improve as the day progresses. There is a western disturbance which is pulling in a lot of moisture, but as the sun comes up, its heat would reduce moisture and pollution levels, thereby improving air quality.""An AQI of above 300, as recorded at various places in the city on Wednesday, falls in the very poor category and people with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion.

Mumbai air quality shifts from poor to moderate in a day as sky clears up,The Times of India (TOI),02-11-2018,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: Residents woke up to much better air quality and clear skies on Friday. Also, there was a further dip in minimum temperatures. On Friday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 175 which falls in the 'moderate' category as compared to 268 a day ago which is in the 'poor' category. The drop on Friday was significant as compared to the past few days when the city was enveloped in haze and visibility had reduced too.An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate and may be a health concern for people sensitive to air pollution. On Friday morning, the minimum temperature recorded by the IMD Santa Cruz observatory was 16.7 degrees Celsius which was 0.5 degree Celsius below normal, while the Colaba observatory logged 20 degrees Celsius, which was 0.6 degree Celsius below normal. KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region), IMD said the cloud cover had moved away. ""Besides, there was no wind movement at all owing to which dust particles remained suspended. This also ended up making visibility low. However, now with clear skies, temperatures have started to dip,"" said Hosalikar. Maximum temperatures also continued to hover around 30 degrees Celsius.

AAP govt hopes for bigger piece of tax pie,The Times of India (TOI),02-01-2018,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: On the eve of the Union Budget, the Delhi government hoped that the Centre would enhance its share in central taxes-a demand made for over 15 years now. The AAP government is also hoping that the Centre would allocate funds to boost its plans to introduce electric buses to promote ashift to clean energy.It has been learnt from reliable sources that in the annual pre-Budget meeting at the ministry of finance, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia made aspecial reference to the state's intention to introduce electric buses. For that the government is learnt to have sought for Rs 2,000 crore.With air pollution posing an existential threat to Delhi, the government circles have been increasingly talking about shifting to greener public transport. 
TOI had reported earlier that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made his keenness for a city-wide plan for zero-emission vehicles known to officials. Last year too, Sisodia had reiterated the demand for an increase in the share in central taxes.This year also, the government sees public transport and pollution as the key challenges. Electric mobility across buses, private cars, taxis, three and two-wheelers would be focused on. But sources in the CM's office cautiously pointed out that electric mobility could not be a quick fix for pollution, though it's part of the long-term plan. The government has been proposing to add electric buses to its public transport fleet this year. This is in sync with its attempts to promote clean energy.According to sources, the biggest challenge in making electric mobility a reality is understanding the capital costs involved. Another test would be to set up facilities to charge these vehicles. ""When you think of scaling up the idea beyond buses to vehicles on the streets like taxis, threewheelers, two-wheelers and even private cars, the scope is huge and will require a detailed policy for execution,"" a source said.There are plans to make way for standard-size electric buses to run on the longer routes and midi and mini-sized ones to provide last-mile connectivity between Delhi Metro stations and residential areas within a 5-km radius.

Central plan to tackle bad air in NCR,The Times of India (TOI),3/13/2018,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Giving legal sanctity to its plan to tackle air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), the Centre has finally notified a comprehensive action plan (CAP) and asked governments in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and their agencies to ensure ""strict implementation"" and time-lines. Track the pollution level in your city Though the plan had been drawn up in January, its formal notification has empowered the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to issue directions for implementation as agreed by all the states and even initiate action for non-compliance.The CAP comprises source-wise clean air action plan and compliance strategy. It specifies a number of measures including actions to reduce vehicular emissions, curtail number of vehicles on road, a parking policy to tackle congestion, control dust from construction and manage waste disposal. 
The action points have been notified by CPCB which on March 6 issued directions to Delhi and the NCR states under Section 3 and 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for compliance. These sections give the central government power to take actions to protect the environment.The actions under the 1986 act include power to direct closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process if they are found to be polluting. It also empowers the Centre to stop or regulate supply of electricity or water or any other service of the polluting industries.Sharing details of notification, environment minister Harsh Vardhan in his written response to a Parliament question in Rajya Sabha said, ""The CAP for management of air pollution in Delhi and NCR has been finalised by the environment ministry in consultation with various stakeholders.""Stating that the plan had been notified for ""strict implementation by concerned agencies"", he said the plan had identified time-lines for agencies to take action under various categories.The CAP includes measures such as setting up of 20 additional real-time monitoring stations by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), expansion of air quality monitoring station across NCR states and undertaking satellite-based monitoring and enforcing agriculture waste burning among others.Though most of the measures, enlisted in the CAP, have consent of Delhi and NCR states, there are few points where the states and central agencies have still been in discussion mode. Such proposed measures include augmenting metro service for carrying more passengers, ensuring NCR connectivity through public transport system (buses and metro) and rationalisation of entry taxes in NCR under reciprocal arrangement.As far as parking policy to reduce congestion and pollution is concerned, the NCR states have agreed to follow Delhi which is expected to finalise its policy and enforcement measures as per the Delhi Master Plan 2021. Under traffic management, the action points under the CAP also proposes considering ""introducing plan for flexistaggered timings to minimise peak movement of vehicles on roads"" by May. The states have also agreed to have a fully electronic system in place by then to monitor traffic violations. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Punjab pollution body to measure pollution levels at toll plazas during peak hours,The Times of India (TOI),03-01-2018,CHANDIGARH,"PATIALA: The Punjab Pollution Control Board has decided to periodically measure the pollution levels at toll plazas during peak hours. Besides, asking project directors of privately managed National Highways and State Highways in the state to initiate measures as per their concession agreements to control dust pollution on the roads. 
KS Pannu, Chairman said the PPCB has asked the companies to ensure that proper plantation in the central verge of the roads and on both sides of the roads is done and maintained. He said it has observed that although the agreement of the road constructing companies includes developing a green cover on the central verge and the sides of the roads, the companies were found lacking in undertaking the job. The PPCB chairman said that the board officials have recently submitted a report in which dust being thrown in the air by vehicles using highways was found to be a major pollutant, especially during the winter season. He said the board has also asked the private companies to make certain that measures to collect dust from roads was put in place. The non-concreate paths between the over bridge and the service lanes was another major dust spots which were not being properly maintained by the road constructing companies resulting in air pollution due to dust.Pannu said PPCB would keep a constant watch on to ensure the directions given to the highway authorities were followed in letter and spirit.

Power plants get 5-star rating in state pollution study,The Times of India (TOI),04-02-2018,NAGPUR,"Nagpur: Nineteen out of 48 industries surveyed in Vidarbha have been given 5-star rating for being 'least polluting' while two have got 1-star for being the 'most polluting'. Industries of the region have fared better than Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) where 29 out of 50 industries were found to be emitting excessive particulate matter.This was brought to the fore by the star-rating programme, the first of its kind project jointly taken up by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India), the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard Kennedy School and Tata Centre for Development (TCD). As per the data, the two most polluting industries are based in Chandrapur - Murli Cement and Vasant Sahakari Sakhar Kharkhana. Also, power plants like Adani (Bhandara), Khaparkheda, Mauda, Koradi, RattanIndia (Amravati) have got 5-star ratings. ACC (Chandrapur), JSW Ispat Steel (Nagpur), Uttam Galva Metallics Limited and Uttam Value Steel Limited too fall in the 'least polluting' category.Apart from this, many industries of Nagpur, Amravati and Chandrapur have been rated two and three stars. These include industries of different sectors like metal works, paper, textiles and power. 
Only industries having at least four recent stack samples (air quality samples taken from chimney of manufacturing units) are eligible to participate in the programme.As reported by TOI earlier, the ratings are based on the median concentration of latest stack samples for particulate matter. Industries emitting PM10 and PM2.5 more than the prescribed limit for stack emissions are rated one, two or three stars while those emitting within the permissible limits fall under four or five star. ""When compared to other cities of the state, Vidarbha has the least number of highly polluting industries,"" said Ishan Choudhary, the communications and outreach coordinator at EPIC-India. The data for MMR, which was released last week, revealed that 29 out of 50 industries in Navi Mumbai, Tarapur, Kalyan and Thane were found to be highly polluting and were rated one and two star. ""The PM10 and PM2.5 emissions of all these industries were much higher than the permissible limits,"" said Choudhary.Launched in June last year, the programme monitors industrial air pollution in 10 clusters of the state - Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and pockets of Gadchiroli.Last year, fewer than 10 industries participated in the exercise. The list now has 48 more. However, industries that took part last year have not been rated this time. MPCB member secretary P Anbalagan said that the board plans to include more industries in the coming days. ""This is a good step towards ensuring transparency in environmental governance. In the first phase, we plan to include over 200 units of the state which will be assessed on air pollution. In the second phase, we plan to incorporate industries which release effluents so that both the pollution parameters can be monitored,"" he added.A meeting was held between MPCB officials, representatives of the industries and some other agencies. The industries have been told about their ratings and performances.""MPCB's programme is path-breaking by providing the public with critical information and rigorously testing its impact on pollution emissions,"" said Michael Greenstone, one of the principal investigators on the project and director of EPIC. ""It is apparent that MPCB is an international leader in identifying low-cost methods to achieve a cleaner environment,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

98% more LMVs on city roads,The Times of India (TOI),5/18/2018,CHANDIGARH,"Chandigarh: In the past 10 years, Chandigarh has become the only city in the country with highest vehicle density in accordance with its size and geographical area that has, over the period of time, a cumulative effect on its air quality index. This was discussed at the air quality management conference held here on Wednesday. While presenting slides from an air quality assessment and monitoring report of Chandigarh at the inaugural session of the conference, scientist from the department of environment Vivek Pandey broadly highlighted five active sources of air pollution in the city. These include increasing number of transport vehicles, industrialisation, road dust re-suspension, horticulture waste and stubble burning from nearby states. 
However, apart from these ambient sources of pollution, a meteoric rise in the number of transport vehicles in the city has greatly contributed towards carbon monoxide. ""The per capita density of vehicles in Chandigarh has seen a surge like no other city has in the country. Chandigarh, as of now, has the density of 878 vehicles over 1,000 persons for UT, Punjab and Haryana combined,"" said Pandey. The rate of vehicular increase in the city has also been highly unusual due to steep increase in light motor vehicles (LMV) like cars and jeeps in comparison to two-wheelers. Computed data available from year 2007 to 2016 suggests that there has been an increase of 98% in LMVs as compared to the increase in two-wheelers, which has just been close to 47%. The number of registered LMVs in the city in 2007 were 1,88,968 and in 2016 this number increased to 3,75,283 in 2016, which saw an increase of 1,86,315 vehicles with an average of 1,552 cars being registered every month. Similarly, the number of total registered two-wheelers in the city in 2007 stood at 4,70,882, while the same saw an increase to 6,95,227 in 2016, with a difference of 2,24,345 two-wheelers. The average of two wheelers being registered each month stood at 1,869. At the same time, the total number of registered vehicles in the city were 6,69,766 in 2007, which increased to 10,96,145 till 2016 with a growth of about 64%. The increase in the number of vehicles stood at 4,26,379. Apart from the LMVs and two-wheelers, the city has 4,500 registered buses and 11,000 goods and other vehicles. ""Chandigarh has the highest numbers of cars per person in India, which is very unusual because in other cities an increase in two-wheelers has surged. However, an increase of 98% in cars in 10 years is much higher than 47% increase in two-wheelers' sales. As a result, ambient air quality in Chandigarh has been mainly affected by vehicular pollution that increases emission of carbon monoxide along with different compounds of nitrogen, among others,"" said Pandey. On factors responsible for increase in the number of LMVs in the city, Pandey said, ""The residents of Chandigarh are economically sound and can afford to buy cars. Over the years, migration into the city has also increased and a show-off culture has also taken precedence. People here like to show-off fancy cars and do not pay a lot of attention towards public transport. The lifestyle has become like that, which is not that common in the western and southern parts of the country."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NGOs find clean air plan weak on pollution checks,The Times of India (TOI),5/16/2018,PUNE,"Pune: City-based environmentalists and NGOs have slammed the Centre's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) draft. They said it mentioned few essential pollution control measures and set no targets.The NCAP, a concept note from the ministry of environment, forests, and climate change (MoEFCC), is open for public comments till Thursday (envfor.nic.in). Most of the concept note is based on the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP), which will use a new and augmented National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).The NAMP plans to augment and increase the air quality monitoring stations all over India, especially in rural areas, and increase the number of Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQS) in high-density population areas. Further innovations like real-time monitoring and public access to the readings have also been proposed.Activists have questioned the rationale of gathering the vast data, while ""very little"" actual pollution control measures proposed.""They need to act on the data and reduce air pollution. 
There is very little of that mentioned in the NCAP,"" Sujit Patwardhan, founder and trustee of Parisar, said. Parisar had recently organised a summit of stakeholders and experts on the NCAP in the city, and sent in a number of recommendations to the Centre.""Public transportation is weak in the city, people depend on personal vehicles for commuting. The PMC and other civic authorities have responded by widening roads and building more flyovers. That approach will imply trees will be cut down and pollution will increase,"" he said.Other NGOs, like Nagrik Chetana Manch (NCM), sent public comments to the Centre, saying that very little will be achieved if targets, a time line, and a large budget are not set, and even the number of monitoring stations proposed is too inadequate."" The draft plan has no enforceable time line for emission targets to be met. The budget is too small and there is no clarity on the entities that will provide the funds. It should be like JNNURM which had a fixed time line and clear budgets. Besides, the new number proposed for air quality monitoring stations is still too less. Only 50 new ones will come up in rural areas,"" Qaneez Sukhrani, the secretary of the NCM, said.The manch noted that there are no emission reduction targets in the draft document, and that cities with vast population differences will have the same number of monitoring stations.""Little has been done to empower state pollution control boards. For garbage burning, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board can only charge a fine. Every year, a grim picture is revealed in the environment status reports of the Pune Municipal Corporation,"" Sukhrani added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

SC asks auto companies to switch over to electric vehicles,The Times of India (TOI),05-03-2018,INDIA,"NEW DELHI: With the Centre expressing inability to bring diesel prices on a par with petrol to discourage people from using the polluting fuel, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked automobile companies to manufacture electric vehicles to curb the menace of air pollution. A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and U Deepak Gupta said many international companies are producing efficient battery-operated vehicles and Indian auto companies should also strive towards that goal and switch over to producing electric vehicles. ""All kinds of electric cars are being manufactured in other countries but you are saying it is not possible in the country. You are perhaps not ready to invest money in manufacturing battery-operated vehicles. Ask your client to switch over to manufacturing batteryrun vehicles. If other companies can manufacture in foreign countries then you can also do it here,"" the bench told Society of Indian Automobile Manufactures (SIAM), an umbrella body of auto companies. SIAM had earlier told the apex court that it was not feasible to manufacture electric vehicles in India due to lack of sufficient infrastructure. It had said there were not enough charging points on the roads to recharge the batteries of electric vehicles to ensure their uninterrupted running. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Air quality near Maurya Lok, vet college very poor",The Times of India (TOI),05-11-2018,PATNA,"PATNA: The air quality near Maurya Lok Complex, Bihar Veterinary College and Walmi has been found to be ""very poor"", as per 'An Assessment Report of Air Quality of Patna City at Different Micro-Environment' released by deputy CM and minister of environment and forest department Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday. The assessment was made by Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA) through Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Energy & Climate Change (CEECC) at ADRI between October 19 and November 28, 2017.The assessment covered major pollutants which were monitored by state-of-the-art mobile air quality monitoring laboratory (MAML) at ten places in the city. As per the report, veterinary college and Walmi reported an AQI of 346 and 307 respectively. 
""This level of AQI is reported to cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The effect may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases,"" the report observed.The area near Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Pant Bhawan, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) premises and Aryabhatta Knowledge University had 'poor' air quality with 297, 284, 258 and 234 AQI respectively. That level of AQI may cause breathing discomfort to people with heart diseases.The report observed that Patna's poor air quality was due to particulate matters and high level of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10) was observed at all locations. ""The traffic sector contributes mainly to high concentration of particulate pollutants and locations like Maurya Lok Complex and Pant Bhawan have concentrations more than the prescribed limit,"" the report said. The level of gaseous pollutants in Patna was found mostly within permissible limit, baring a few exceptions.Modi said the state government would soon write a letter to the central government to make provisions for banning vehicles older than 15 years in big cities such as in Patna to check air pollution. ""The Motor Vehicles Act 1988 has no provision to ban vehicles older than 15 years. NCR region is an exception to this. We, till the time being, will try to make the provisions to obtain pollution control certificate more stringent,"" he said. However, Modi said though air pollution was a big problem, there was no need to panic. ""I have asked BSPCB to install at least three out of the proposed five air quality monitoring stations in the next 6 to 8 months. Data gaps in the air quality assessment by Patna's only monitoring station provides insufficient information,"" he said.Modi also asked BSPCB to come up with a toll-free number for people to register their complaints relating to pollution issues. He also announced plantation of 10,000 trees by the state government in the city and along the banks of the Ganga where the top alluvial soil was exposed leading to an increase in dust particles in the air.

'PM Modi neither talks to me nor lets me talk',The Times of India (TOI),6/18/2018,TOP STORIES,"Sitting on dharna outside the LG's office for six days demanding an end to a 'strike' by IAS officers of Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal has drawn fire from opposition parties for 'abandoning post' while the capital has been battling water shortage. He spoke to Alok KN Mishra about this deadlock. Following are the excerpts:How long do you plan to continue the protest?\x95 The strike by IAS officers has stalled many important works concerning the people of Delhi. 
The IAS officers do not attend any meeting convened by ministers, they do not respond to phone calls of ministers, nor do they go on any field visits with ministers. It is extremely strange that soon after our government was formed in Delhi, the Modi government snatched all our powers concerning the transfers and postings of officers. Today the elected Delhi government cannot take any action on officers. The officers' strike has been instigated by the central government to paralyse the Delhi government.What if the LG does not respond to your demands?\x95 We need to understand why this officers' strike was instigated. Despite being faced with numerous hurdles created by the Centre, the AAP government has performed wonderfully. So people are asking if the AAP government did not allow private schools to hike their fees, and made tests and medicines available for free in government hospitals, what did the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh do in so many years? If electricity tariffs in Delhi are the lowest in the country, why PM Modi couldn't do so in the country in the last four years? So they devised this way to paralyse our government. But I want to assure the people of Delhi that I will tirelessly keep working for their welfare and their rights till my last breath. Until they end the IAS officers' strike, we will not step back.You have said that work has been affected because officers are not attending meetings. Can you share which are the key areas that have been hit?\x95 On Friday, environment minister Imran Hussain had convened a meeting on tackling air pollution. The environment secretary and member secretary did not turn up. Officers have not attended meetings on desilting of drains, tackling dengue and chikungunya, whitewashing of schools, setting up mohalla clinics, work on Signature Bridge, etc.You and three other ministers are camping at LG's office. How is that impacting governance?\x95 I have already said that the officers' strike has been instigated to paralyse our government.Your appeals to PM Narendra Modi have not been answered till now. Do you plan to end the stir and attend the NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday to seek his intervention?\x95 I have written to the PM and appealed to him that before the meeting, the strike should be called off. It will end within a minute if the PM wants. I have attended many meetings in which the PM is present, but he neither talks to me nor looks at me. In these meetings, the representative of Delhi is not given an opportunity to speak.After a long time, you have stepped up the attack on PM.\x95 I am appealing to him with folded hands that he should intervene and put an end to the strike due to which Delhi has got a bad name across the world. The world is seeing that the officers are not working, and an elected chief minister and his ministers are sitting for six days to get a strike ended. Delhi government's work is being lauded the world over and in September former UN secretary general Kofi Annan along with several other international dignitaries will visit India to see the mohalla clinics.You say the AAP government has performed better than BJP governments in other states. How did that happen if IAS officers were not supporting you?\x95 Despite all obstacles in our way, it is our will power and honest politics that has seen our government deliver.On February 19, the chief secretary came for a midnight meeting. What happened all of a sudden that all bureaucrats started boycotting the routine meetings with you and other ministers?\x95 There was no attack. It is a ploy to destabilise our government. Since the matter is now in court, I will appeal to all to wait for the verdict.Do you think it is reasonable for a CM to go to meet the LG with an appointment and refuse to leave his office unless his demands are met?\x95 We tried our best to resolve this issue through dialogue. For the last three months, we did everything possible to reason with the LG. I have myself met him four times, Manish Sisodia met him four times, Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain met him thrice. We also wrote to him. Every time, he said just one thing: that he wanted a week's time to resolve everything. Then we realised that the Centre wants us to remain a lameduck government. So we decided to fight.BJP leaders are on dharna outside your office demanding your return to work.\x95 It is beyond any reasonable understanding why they are on dharna. On the one hand they are saying that the officers are not on strike and doing good work; on the other, they are saying there is problem with electricity and water.A severe water crisis has hit the city when you as water minister are on dharna. What have you done?\x95 I agree there is a water problem in some parts of Delhi. But in the last three months, whenever I called up the DJB CEO, he did not answer. Barring the formal board meetings, he refuses to attend any meeting. How do I work? For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Rajasthan youths fast losing battle against pollution,The Times of India (TOI),06-06-2018,JAIPUR,"JAIPUR: Delhi might take the centre stage when hazards of air pollution are discussed, but Rajasthan's air too offers people a host of environmental challenges.A recently released, Centre's report, says that Rajasthan is at the top in the list of states which is losing years of healthy life to premature death and suffering due to air pollution.When a 28-year-old person, reached hospital with symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the doctors were surprised while examining him concluding that his lungs capacity was just 40%. He was a non-smoker. Doctors tried to understand that atthis young age, COPD among non-smoker is an indication of environment getting more polluted causing serious diseases.""His functioning of lungs has gone down up to 40%. COPD is a disease which is irreversible. His condition will deteriorate further. 
Earlier, there was a trend of COPD cases in the age above 40 years, but now more cases are reported in early age, which are less than 40 years. It is quite a dangerous sign,"" said Dr Narendra Khippal, professor, department of chest & respiratory diseases, Sawai Man Singh Medical College.COPD is one of the environmental pulmonary diseases result from inhalation of dusts, allergens, chemicals, gases, or environmental pollutants. Due to pollution, the lungs are continually exposed to the external environment and are susceptible to a host of environmental challenges. According to health experts, pathologic processes can involve any part of the lungs, including the airways (occupational asthma, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, toxic inhalations, air pollution-related illness, or byssinosis), lung parenchyma (pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or silicosis), Pleura (asbestos-related diseases).""The WHO estimates the population-attributable fraction of COPD related to occupational and environmental exposures to be about 20% (ie, COPD incidence and mortality would decline by about 20% if environmental exposures were reduced to zero),"" said Dr Khippal.Health experts claimed that death rate due to COPD is highest in the state when comparing with other states of the country. ""The study released by the health ministry on the Health of the Nation's States-a study of how the burden of disease has changed in Indian states from 1990 to 2016, shows that Rajasthan is at the top in the list of states which is losing years of healthy life to premature death and suffering due to air pollution,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, former professor (pulmonary medicine), Sawai Man Singh Medical College.Dr Singh said, ""There are many reasons for air pollution. Here in the state, people use wood as fuel for cooking. In cities, like Jaipur, vehicular pollution has increased as more vehicles are added to existing vehicles every year. Industries emitting smoke polluting the environment.""Besides, in the state, mining is done rampantly across the state, which also causes pollution by adding particulate matter in the air.

Netaji Nagar project flouted order to plant trees before felling?,The Times of India (TOI),6/26/2018,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Almost 2,500 trees are to be cut to pave the way for redevelopment of government accommodation at Netaji Nagar. This was allowed on the condition that the building authority, NBCC, complies with a September 2017 order by the National Green Tribunal that saplings should be planted before the trees are felled.However, NBCC does not seem to have complied with the order. CMD AK Mittal told TOI it had the necessary permission and had paid the sum required for afforestation.The NGT order said NBCC needed to ""plant tall trees at the venue...at the first instance and if space falls short, plantation shall be done... at the site allocated (Yamuna floodplain)"".Delhi forest department had later given permission for felling of 2,490 trees for the Netaji Nagar project.The environmental clearance, issued by the Union environment ministry, stated a minimum of one tree for every 80sqm of land should be planted and maintained. The existing trees will be counted for the purpose and preference should be given to native species. 
""Where the trees need to be cut, compensatory plantation in the ratio of 1:10 (planting 10 trees for every tree cut) shall be done and maintained in compliance with NGT directions... as proposed a green belt area shall be provided."" EC stated.NBCC CMD AK Mittal told TOI: ""The permission for tree felling was given by Delhi government in October 2017, but the NGT order was before that. The authorised agency has given us permission for Netaji Nagar and Nauroji Nagar and we have transferred the amount we were to pay for compensatory afforestation.""A Delhi forest department official said: ""The user agency - in this case, NBCC - is supposed to meet the conditions stipulated in EC. They had the option of going to NGT again to seek relief from NGT's order.""Another issue that has taken aback environmental experts is that Delhi's air pollution problem hasn't been factored in comprehensively while issuing the EC. While the current challenges of debris, dust and diesel emissions during the construction phase have been addressed, the issue of how ecological services provided by thousands of trees here will be lost hasn't been discussed adequately.Experts are particularly concerned that compensatory afforestation was not done before felling because of poor compliance in the past. CAG, in its 2018 report, highlighted that, on average, about 9 lakh trees are planted annually in Delhi that should have resulted in an annual increase of 13.84 sqkm in forest and tree cover. But as per the State of Forest Report, Delhi has increased only 5.83sq km of forest and tree cover in eight years between 2009 and 2017. ""This puts a question mark on the efficacy and performance of Delhi government's tree plantation programme. They should examine as to why their annual tree plantation efforts have not been resulting in commensurate increase in forest and tree cover,"" the report stated.The environment impact assessment reports for redevelopment projects in Nauroji Nagar and Sarojini Nagar reveal that several important native species will be lost from the area, including mango, neem, sahtoot, kachnar, jungle jalebi, champa, peepal, guava, oleander and bael. These saplings will be planted in different parts of the Yamuna floodplain, according to the permissions issued by the forest department.""The EC and the NGT order are clear that felling should happen only after compensatory plantation. Merely depositing the money for it is not enough. CAG has found severe non-compliance in implementing compensatory afforestation. Also, plantation of saplings cannot compensate for the loss of old, native trees,"" Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher and director at Namati Environment Justice Program, said.

""On Saturday, a few local residents, including Asfak Gulam, barged into his factory and demanded at knifepoint that he pay Rs 20,000,"" said a senior police official.The complainant has alleged that Gulam and a few others also beat him up and tried to ransack his office. ""The complainant has mentioned in his FIR that timely intervention saved him,"" the official said.Residents of Narol and surrounding areas have often complained of air pollution. In some areas of eastern Ahmedabad such as Vatva, residents have often complained of contaminated water in boring wells.Narol police sources said they are verifying the details mentioned in the FIR.

CPCB: Enforce full pollution action plan,The Times of India (TOI),07-06-2018,DELHI,"New Delhi: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has recently directed the implementation of the entire 'Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for Air Pollution Control in Delhi and NCR' under Section 5 of the environment protection act.This plan mandates, among other things, closure of the Badarpur thermal power plant by mid-2018, restoration of the 600ha fly ash pond at Badarpur, and enforcement of air pollution control measures in all industries, including those located in unauthorised colonies.The Union environment ministry had notified parts of the plan in March but left out important action points because there was no agreement on timelines for their implementation. The interventions that were left out included tightening pollution under control (PUC) norms, on-board diagnostic systems in vehicles, enforcement of air pollution control norms in all industries and permanent closure of the Badarpur plant. 
An official of the Badarpur plant said it had been proposed to be shut down by July but ""we have no communication from the environment ministry or CPCB yet"". As the Tughlakabad sub-station hasn't been commissioned yet, the Badarpur plant is being run based on requirement, he added. According to IIT-Kanpur's 2015 source apportionment study, industrial stack emissions are responsible for 11% of PM2.5 emissions in the winter. ""CAP is a legally binding document. If its elements are implemented soon, it will help in winter,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.

Maharashtra reality check: Mumbai among 17 toxic cities with no action plan,The Times of India (TOI),8/25/2018,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: Despite having the most polluted cities in the country, Maharashtra has no mitigation plans for even a single city.Details obtained by Greenpeace India under Right to Information (RTI) have revealed shocking facts about 'missing' action plans for 17 cities in the state. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had identified these cities as 'non-attainment' based on ambient air quality monitoring. Major pollutants like particulate matter 10 and nitrogen dioxide crossed dangerous levels in those cities between 2011-15.As part of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), nonattainment cities had to submit individual action plans to curb air pollution. 
Replying to an RTI query, CPCB stated that the cities were told to submit plans before August.In a reply on August 20, the board said none of the 17 cities has an implementable action plan ready. The board's records suggest that even though seven out of those cities had submitted plans, CPCB told the cities to revise and resubmit them.The cities include Mumbai, Pune, Amravati, Aurangabad, Jalna, Kolhapur and Latur. ""The submitted plans were merely responses to directions of CPCB sent to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in July 2016. Important aspects like scientific approach to identify polluting sectors and including time-bound targets for improving air quality were missing,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India.In its report 'Airpocalypse', the environment group pointed out that 25 cities in the state have toxic air. ""While CPCB has identified 17 polluted cities based on 2011-15 data, we analysed air pollution data of 2015 and 2016, which shows that 25 cities exceed permissible annual limits of PM10,"" said Dahiya.The World Health Organization (WHO) report, released in May, warned that after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra was on the verge of becoming one of the country's most polluted states. As per WHO data, air quality in at least six cities of the state was almost four-toeight times worse than standards set by the global organization. Last winter, pollution levels in the state became as bad as those in Beijing. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Amritsar: CNG set to help reduce pollution level in holy city,The Times of India (TOI),08-09-2018,AMRITSAR,"AMRITSAR: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), the clean burning fuel, is all set to fix air pollution problem in the holy city with as many as four retail outlets of CNG likely to supply the fuel in next couple of months even as the CNG-kit installation facility is yet to begin.Gujarat Gas Limited would open four retail outlets in the city, out of which permission to three outlets had been granted, said deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangah while talking to TOI on Wednesday.He said the administration had always been encouraging to use clean fuel to bring down the pollution levels in the city.Company sources said that the dispensers and compressors would be installed at the existing Indian Oil Limited petrol pumps. ""We have already installed a dispenser on a petrol pump near The Mall of Amritsar which will begin supplying CNG in about a months time,"" said sources.The company had also laid pipes for supplying Piped Natural Gas (PNG) to households, small businessmen and industry etc. which is likely to replace the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders.Sangha said that CNG was not only economical, but was one of the preferred alternative fuel sources for vehicles.The administration had earlier taken several measures to bring down the air pollution level from the city but to no avail. Diesel-driven auto-rickshaws contribute maximum to the air pollution especially in the vicinity of the Golden Temple.Company source say that with the supply of CNG, the CNG kit manufacturers were all set to establish their renters for installation of CNG kits in petrol drive vehicles.""CNG is more than 55% cheaper than petrol and around 40% cheaper than diesel in running cost per kilometre,"" he said.

"Along national highway, a 2km stretch of garbage",The Times of India (TOI),09-03-2018,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: Heaps of garbage can be spotted if one is travelling on NH-8 from Kherki Daula towards Manesar. The garbage that extends from NSG Camp in Manesar all the way to Kukrola, over a distance of some 2km, has prompted some serious public concerns. While environmentalists blame the authorities for turning a blind eye to the garbage, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) claims to have cleaned the stretch numerous times but ""local people continue to throw trash"".Ram Avtar Yadav, an environmentalist and former sarpanch of Manesar panchayat, said, ""Drivers have become accustomed to the sight of piles of trash littering on the road. 
This trash is not thrown by people from Manesar but by commuters and construction projects outside this area."" ""People consider this part of the highway as an ideal spot to throw garbage as it can be cleaned. I feel that the government should install cameras and penalise offenders,"" he added.Terming municipal solid waste as one of the most serious pollutants in the country, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in 2016 ordered the imposition of a fine of Rs 10,000 on any person or agency found throwing garbage at public places. The green court then said that all authorities were under statutory obligation to ensure that the waste was collected, transported and disposed of in accordance with Solid Waste Management Rules of 2016 so that it doesn't cause public health concerns. ""But the trash mounds grow with each passing day without being collected. When the rubbish becomes too much to handle, people from the vicinity would burn them. The smoke from the burning piles could last for a whole day, considerably reducing the visibility of the road and severely polluting the air,"" said Yadav.When contacted, NN Giri, NHAI's project director and GM (technical), Jaipur, said, ""This is a pertinent problem in the area. People often throw trash alongside the national highway. I have got the entire stretch cleared so many times but this trash comes up again. There is no end to this issue.""""However, we will clean up all waste construction material which is lying on the highway,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

EPCA gets tough with NCR on clean air plan but how will it stop use of diesel gensets?,The Times of India (TOI),9/14/2018,GURGAON,"Delhi cannot win the battle to clean up its air if NCR cities don't follow suit. And NCR cities will remain a problem because of widespread use of diesel generator sets, necessitated by power outages.Reducing use of diesel generator sets will be the biggest challenge before the EPCA (Environment Pollution Control Authority), which on Thursday asked the district magistrates of NCR cities like Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad to implement the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) with immediate effect.GRAP was introduced last year to combat pollution levels during the winter months when weather conditions and crop stubble burning push up both PM2.5 and PM10 levels. Last year, NCR cities were permitted to use diesel gensets and exempted from the odd-even scheme due to lack of infrastructure but those exemptions have been lifted this year.EPCA chairman Bhure Lal said, ""DG sets can't run in NCR. In case of emergency, the DG set user will have to obtain a certificate from the discom stating that even a temporary connection of electricity is not possible in the region.""But this will be virtually impossible to implement in Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad unless the power discoms in the three cities come up with a magic formula to completely stop outages in the winter months. 
And even if they somehow do manage this, it still won't stop widespread use of diesel gensets.Both in highrise-dense Gurugram and Noida, there are whole residential towers and also entire housing societies that run on high-power diesel gensets because they don't have an official power connection from the discom. Gurgaon's new sectors (58-115) run entirely on gensets because power substations have not yet been built. According to an estimate, there are around 11,000 diesel gensets of 500kVA capacity in Gurugram. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in June this year pointed out that diesel gensets trigger a 30% increase in pollution levels. Most condominiums in NCR provide uninterrupted power to residents by using diesel gensets that automatically switch on if an outage happens so that basic services like elevators are not disrupted. Since outages happen daily and are frequent, gensets are the lifeline of all housing societies.""It is extremely difficult to ban diesel gensets as there are many societies that don't have any power supply, especially in new sectors. We will seek a clarification from EPCA,"" said a Gurugram administration official.Asked if poor power infrastructure and supply were considered, Bhure Lal later told TOI, ""I will talk to the power secretary of Haryana and ascertain the power supply condition. Electricity is surplus in India and if they are failing to meet the supply, they can get connected to the grid and get enough supply.""According to GRAP, ban on diesel gensets will be implemented if the PM10 level rises above 800 micrograms per cubic metre and PM2.5 above 500 micrograms per cubic metre. GRAP lists separate sets of action plans depending on the levels of air quality - moderate, poor, very poor and severe. Use of diesel gensets will, however, be allowed in hospitals, nursing homes, health care centres, at metro facilities, railway stations and bus terminals.Police have, meanwhile, been asked to ensure traffic that is not Delhi-bound does not enter Delhi for a detour.""NCR needs to work to implement all GRAP measures,"" Bhure Lal said. ""While I appreciate some steps like incentivising gram panchayats of Haryana to ensure zero crop stubble burning, there is a lot that NCR needs to do,"" he added, echoing the views he expressed last week to UP officials when he slammed the state government for not doing anything to bring down pollution levels.The EPCA chief also ordered closure of all brick kilns with immediate effect. ""Whether the brick kilns have zig-zag technology or not, all brick kilns will have to remain shut till February 1 in NCR,"" he said. Instructions were given to implement strict ban on waste burning, construction waste dumping and increasing the number of CNG buses. ""If garbage is seen burning anywhere, first pour water on it and extinguish the fire. Then take strict action against the offender,"" Bhure Lal said.Talking about the measures to monitor air pollution, Lal said, ""Installation of air monitoring machines is delayed by more than one year and should be completed this winter.""

Lucky draw for cracker of a Diwali,The Times of India (TOI),10/31/2018,CHANDIGARH,"CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh administration has issued 96 crackers licences for nine sites to traders through draw of lots, which was held at deputy commissioner's office in Sector 17, on Monday. There were total 1,043 applications against 96 cracker licences. The UT administration had decided to issue only 96 crackers licences after direction by the Punjab and Haryana high court. 
The UT administration has identified only nine sites for selling crackers. Among these, maximum applications were submitted for Sector 43, Manimajra and Sector 46.The administration has issued seven licences for Sector 29, 15 for Sector 46, 9 for Sector 24, 15 for Sector 43, 15 for Manimajra, 8 for Ram Darbar, 9 each for sectors 20, 33 and 37. As the UT had not received fire no-objection certificate (NOC) for two sites in Sector 24 and Manimajra, it had decided to shift the sites to some other location, on Monday. The administration issued only one license per family. The traders opposed UT's move and they claimed the condition should have been told them while submitting application, but to no avail. There were cases where two people from the same family got lucky during the draw of lots, but the UT officials reject one permit and gave license to only one family member. Last year, the UT administration had received 614 applications but licences were given to 96 traders only.A senior UT official said that they were following the Punjab and Haryana high court directions and accordingly draw of lots were held on Monday. The court had allowed licences only to 20% of the 480 cracker licensees that were there in 2016. The HC had issued these directions to check pollution, he added.Last year, cracker sellers of the Tricity had suffered losses of around Rs 50 crore due to issuance of limited number of licences.To curb air and noise pollution in the city, the Chandigarh administration has fixed hours for bursting firecrackers during the festive season. The UT administration has ordered a ban on bursting of all types of firecrackers with immediate effect till November 24, other than on Dussehra (October 19) from 5pm to 8pm, Diwali (November 7) from 6.30pm to 9.30pm and on Gurpurb (November 23) from 6.30pm to 9.30pm .

Attention: The air quality is going bad again. Here's what you should do,The Times of India (TOI),10/19/2018,HEALTH,"The slight nip in the air and the urge to switch off fans during the night point towards one single fact --winters are here. And with winters, it is the dreaded Delhi air pollution that has made a comeback too. So if you have noticed some discomfort in breathing or are facing any other respiratory problem, it isn't your mind playing tricks but the air quality in Delhi has actually become very poor since Monday.With the progression of winters, pollution level in the National Capital will continue to get worse and it is only intelligent to brace yourself for the worst. 
The air quality gets really poor during winters because when the temperature drops, pollutants get trapped in the air causing it to become really toxic and unfit to breathe in. Here is the list of do's and don'ts you need to strictly follow in order to protect yourself from the toxic air. 1. Avoid the main roadsIn order to combat the air pollution level, one must stay away from the high capacity urban roads. This happens because air pollution is extremely high in a very congested road. If you stay away at least 30 to 50 metres away from the main road, it is bound to be to three times less polluted than the main road. 2. Don't go running outsideAs a rule of thumb, try and avoid exercising as much as you can when the air quality is poor. This is because the more active you are, the more polluted air you are breathing. If you really want to exercise, do it indoors. Special attention must be paid in case of children and elders. 3. Stay informed about the pollution levelsKeep a tab on the pollution level of the areas you are visiting. This will help you avoid areas with a very low quality of air. 4. Eat green veggiesWhile you should always maintain healthy eating habits, it becomes essential to include fresh fruits and green vegetables in your diet, when the air quality has turned extremely poor. In fact, broccoli is especially good for detoxing your lungs. According to research conducted by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, if you eat broccoli regularly for around 3 months, it might help to detoxify your lungs. This happens because green vegetables help the body to maintain its antioxidants. 5. Be wary of indoor pollutionWith all the attention being on outdoor pollution, we often forget indoor pollution is in fact deadlier. In fact, even scented candles--which are ideally used to relax and meditate--should be completely avoided. This is because scented candles increase the particle concentrations indoors. 6. Use exhaust fan while cooking alwaysAccording to WHO around 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to household air pollution. Hence, one must always use an exhaust fan while cooking on gas. It is strictly advisable to use a fan with a filter for more safety. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Sterlite: NGT panel seeks more time to submit report,The Times of India (TOI),10/16/2018,CHENNAI,"CHENNAI: The three-member committee, which was constituted by the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to look into the Tamil Nadu Government's closure order against Sterlite, has sought more time to hear the view of all sides.The committee is headed by the former chief justice of the Meghalaya high court Tarun Agarwal. It has two other members - Satish C Garkoti, scientist with the ministry of environment and forests, and H D Varalaksmi, a senior scientist with the central pollution control board regional directorate. 
The panel was formed to check air and water pollution.The panel visited Tuticorin on September 22 and returned to Chennai the following day. During their 24-hour visit, the panel inspected a waterbody and the Sterlite factory.Meanwhile, the authorities of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) have pleaded with the panel to extend the time to submit their report on air and water pollution.""The chairman of the panel urged the NGT to extend time to hear the views of all sides.

City will use less coal power this winter,The Times of India (TOI),10/26/2018,DELHI,"New Delhi: After the closure of the polluting Badarpur power plant due to environmental concerns, the Delhi government is looking to cut down on more coal-based electricity to combat air pollution this winter. The power department has informed National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) that the city will not need power from the Dadri-I thermal power station for the winter power load as the Bawana plant is now equipped to generate 800-900 MW. Now, Delhi will source power from only two coal-based plants, Dadri-II and Aravalli super thermal stations. 
The rest of Delhi's need is met by environment-friendly, gas-based stations.The decision to skip the Dadri-I plant was taken in a high-level meeting held this month with senior officials of the power ministry, NTPC, Environment Pollution (prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) and Delhi government officials. ""Unless there is some contingency, Delhi will not require power from Dadri-I for the winter months of November to February. Adequate arrangements have been made to meet the winter load, and we do not anticipate any problem,"" said secretary (power) Varsha Joshi. Delhi gets about 600MW from the Dadri-I station, a shortfall that officials say will be met by the enhanced generation from the Bawana plant. ""Now that the Bawana plant has a gas tie-up, it can generate more than enough to make up for Dadri-I. The power demand in winter is also less,"" said an official.The Aravalli and Dadri-II plants together produce up to 2,000MW. The rest of Delhi's power comes from its own generating stations - Pragati, Bawana and GT - and its shares in various other central sector plants. With the commencement of the 400kV Tughlaqabad substation this month, Delhi has got a much needed boost in infrastructure connectivity as the power produced in the Bawana station can now flow to all parts of the city. While most of the blame for Delhi's poor air quality is put on stubble burning in nearby states, a lot of blame has also been placed on coal-based power plants with the Supreme Court-appointed EPCA ensuring the closure of the Badarpur station. ""We have tried to cut back on coal-fired power for Delhi as much as possible this season. The city, however, still needs power from the Dadri II and Aravalli stations, which are critical for the islanding scheme,"" said Joshi. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Lucknow again breathing in 'very poor' air,The Times of India (TOI),11/28/2018,LUCKNOW,"LUCKNOW: After fall in air pollution levels for two consecutive days, there was a sharp increase in air toxicity on Monday. The sharp rise saw city's air quality dropping from 'poor' to 'very poor' category. The exposure to such air can lead to respiratory problems in people.Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 373 on Monday, around 100 units more than Sunday. Lucknow was third most polluted city in the country after Patna and Ghaziabad with AQIs of 408 and 398, respectively. The city was more polluted than Delhi where the AQI was 336. Lalbagh was the most polluted area with PM2.5 concentration of 324.6 micrograms per unit of air.Area around Lucknow University was the least polluted in the city as per the air quality monitoring station of LU.""The sharp increase in air pollution is due to minimum temperatures coming down to around 10 degree Celsius. Low temperatures do not allow the particulate matter to disperse. The situation is likely to worsen in the coming days when temperatures will fall further,"" said, director, air quality monitoring station, Lucknow University, Prof Dhruv Sen Singh.

"'Severe' pollution to return, days to get colder, hazier",The Times of India (TOI),11-04-2018,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: With wind speed picking up, Gurugram's air quality index (AQI) improved to 336 on Saturday, still 'very poor' but better than the 'severe' levels the city experienced for three days in a row earlier in the week. It may, however, increase to 'severe' level from Monday again. The maximum and minimum temperatures are, meanwhile, likely to fall by up to five degrees in the next three to four days.Officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said stringent measures taken by authorities reduced air pollution levels. 
""Due to meteorological factors and strict implementation of GRAP steps, the city has witnessed a drop in pollution levels. Now, the AQI is in the 'very poor' category. The situation is expected to improve on Sunday,"" an official of HSPCB told TOI.Track the pollution level in your cityWhile Ghaziabad was the least polluted city with AQI at 325, Noida and Delhi reported AQI at 333 and 340, respectively. Faridabad and Greater Noida, on the other hand, reported AQI at 359 and 341, respectively.According to officials of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), though the air quality is expected to improve further on Sunday, it may be in 'severe' category on Monday. The AQI on Sunday is likely to remain between 360 and 370.Bhure Lal from Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, however, blamed NCR cities for causing pollution in Delhi. ""There is an urgent need for authorities in NCR cities, including Gurgaon, to ensure all measures under GRAP are implemented effectively,"" he said.Met officials, meanwhile, attributed the improvement in air quality to a western disturbance. Temperatures, they said, are likely to fall in the next three to four days in Gurugram, with the minimum temperature, currently at 18 degrees, likely to come down to 13. In a statement, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre said under the influence of the western disturbance, the ""atmosphere is likely to be unstable over the region, which would result in mixing of the pollutants and improved air quality till November 5.""Officials said that mornings are likely to get mistier while shallow fog is expected to remain. 87 challans issued in pollution crackdownSince November 1, MCG has issued 87 challans, which translates to Rs 5.75 lakh in fines, for polluting activities. The corporation issued two challans worth Rs 15,000 for open burning of garbage, 44 challans worth Rs 3.55 lakh for construction activities and 24 challans to those transporting construction material without covering it. The remaining challans were issued for open dumping of construction waste.FIR for garbage burning in openMCG on Friday lodged a complaint against two companies for burning garbage in the open. Sanitation inspector Bijender Sharma was on patrol duty when he spotted a person burning garbage near a private school in Sector 76.

Lessons from a green oasis for a city that can't breathe,The Times of India (TOI),11-12-2018,DELHI,"New Delhi: With much of the focus on Delhi's pollution hotspots at Anand Vihar and the industrial areas of Narela, Bawana, Mundka and Jahangirpuri, the air quality monitoring station at Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences in Dilshad Garden has not got much attention. It should, because when most other monitoring stations recorded the air quality as ""very poor"" or ""severe"" in October, this one indicated an oasis with the air only in the ""moderate"" or ""poor"" category. In fact, there was only a single ""very poor"" day recorded in October. 
Even in November, while air pollution has spiked alarmingly across Delhi, repeatedly entering the ""severe"" zone, IHBAS has remained an exception, even though it has flirted with the danger mark on a couple of days. On November 11, the IHBAS station showed an AQI of 361.3 at 9pm against an overall figure of 470.4 for Delhi. A look at where this air quality monitoring station is located might explain the seeming anomaly. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set this up among greenery, and when TOI visited the site, the PM2.5 reading displayed on the board outside was as low as 68 micrograms per cubic metre at a time when the city's average was 200 micrograms. This place had close to the safe standard of 60 micrograms of PM2.5.While Delhi's average AQI reading for October was over 250, the average at the IHBAS station was just under 160. The station also recorded seven ""satisfactory"" days when the AQI dipped below 100.Experts say the station is a good indicator of what can happen when you have greenery around your house or a tree buffer capable of trapping pollutants and dust. ""The effect of the greenery shows that pollution can be controlled and reduced. This is also an indicator of the difference in air quality in a park and a busy intersection with a lot of traffic,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment.Chowdhury also said that Delhi now had a good mix of locations for the monitoring stations and this would help agencies track the hotspots. ""We now have monitors in green locations, on roadsides, in industrial areas, even in residential colonies. The readings for each station can help us take localised response measures,"" she explained.Arun Sharma, professor at the University College of Medical Sciences in Dilshad Garden, pointed out that the greenery at IHBAS was not the only factor for the low readings. This was also because of low vehicular and industrial emissions at the spot. ""The entire area is green, but there's very little vehicular traffic and almost no industries in the area,"" noted Sharma. ""These result in the good air quality. All these factors can help people determine how to create a low-pollution area."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Delhi: Little change in pollution despite SC push, 310 arrests for bursting crackers",The Times of India (TOI),11-09-2018,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Tradition trumped law and concern over air pollution as a large number of Delhiites openly defied the Supreme Court's guidelines and celebrated Diwali on Wednesday by bursting traditional firecrackers despite a major crackdown.Track the pollution level in your cityWhile reports suggested fewer crackers were burst this year than in 2017, air quality the day after Diwali was almost as bad. The average AQI recorded on Thursday was 390, at ""very poor"" level bordering on ""severe"" and just 13 notches below last year's post-Diwali level (403). CPCB said early morning pollution post-Diwali this year was higher than last year's level.In a first for the capital, police registered 634 cases and arrested 310 people for bursting crackers. The crackdown, however, failed to deter people. Some 2,776kg of banned crackers were seized on Diwali while being clandestinely sold or supplied in some areas.However, this was just a tenth of the crackers burst across the city on the festive night, according to estimates. 
Most violators were caught bursting crackers in gated colonies or outside their houses on the basis of complaints by residents. Most of the complaints were received from west and southwest Delhi, while the maximum number of cases were registered in outer Delhi.Delhi's air quality on Diwali day oscillated between ""poor"" and ""very poor"" as authorities warned of severe rise in pollution even if the fireworks were contained at 50% of last year's level. On Thursday morning, most air quality monitoring stations across the city had ""very poor"" to ""severe"" air quality.Last year, Delhi had an air quality index of 319 on Diwali day, which falls in the very poor category on Diwali. However, this was much better than 2016 when AQI on Diwali was 431 in severe levels and 343 in 2015. In the wee hours of the day after Diwali 2017, the AQI for Delhi was 340. In 2016, the AQI of the day after was 445 while in 2015 it was 360. This year, it stood at 390.Showing vastly different AQI levels than the central pollution board, government's pollution research body, SAFAR, said the AQI in Delhi on Thursday was ""severe plus"" with a reading of over 500. This was worse than last year's post-Diwali day but better than the levels in 2016.""Air quality index entered severe category at 2am early morning on November 8 and will remain severe until late evening of November 11. However, air quality is recovering from afternoon and likely to touch very poor range by night, provided no additional local emissions are added. The contribution of PM 2.5 in PM 10 has increased from 50% (normal) to 70% last night, indicating increased share of locally generated pyrotechnic emissions,"" said SAFAR in a report on Thursday.According to Central Pollution Control Board officials, significant drop in temperature of about 8 degree C, reduced wind speed especially during night were two important factors that might have contributed to delayed dispersion because of which higher PM concentration values are reported during night hours.""The average mixing height on Diwali day in 2017 and 2018 was in similar range (400-600 m). The average wind speed was also similar (1.6 m/sec) in both the years but the wind speed decreased to 0.8m/sec on Diwali night... Wind direction was from northwest which might have added pollutant load from stubble burning,"" a CPCB official said.The contribution of stubble burning in overall PM2.5 concentration during Diwali this year has been estimated as 10% by IITM.""More active fire incidences have been reported this year on Diwali (4,203) compared to Diwali of 2017 (1,702). Particulate levels started increasing since 9pm on November 7, and remained quite high during night. The areas represented by monitoring stations at Ashok Vihar, Jahangirpur, Nehru Nagar, Okhla phase II, Rohini, Vivek Vihar and Wazirpur recorded very high particulate values during 11pm to 6am. This may be due to unfavourable conditions coupled with pollutants generated from fireworks,"" the CPCB said, adding that particulate concentrations were slightly higher this year as compared to 2017.Jahangirpuri, arguably one of the most polluted spots in Delhi, had the highest PM10 reading at 4,499 microgram per cubic metre, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee real-time monitoring at 11pm and was the highest across DPCC stations on Diwali night. Wazirpur, at 1am, saw PM2.5, the finer particulate matter, touching an astronomically high 4,659 microgram per cubic metre, the highest across all DPCC stations this Diwali. The permissible limit of PM10 and PM2.5 are 100 and 60 microgram per cubic metre. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Exotic orchids turn stress-busters,The Times of India (TOI),11/13/2018,BENGALURU,"BENGALURU : Orchids - with their varied shapes, colours and fragrances - are turning out to be stress-busters for Bengalureans who return home after a hectic day at work and long commute on traffic stricken roads.Many visitors at the sixth edition of the orchid show held at Lalbagh Botanical Gardens on Sunday shared these views with TOI.Shubashini N, a resident of BTM Layout and software professional, said these exotic plants relieve her of office tension in addition to enhancing the beauty of her home. ""These plants are affordable and have long shelf life. Some can be kept for six months to three years, based on how you maintain it,"" she added.Nancy Fernandes and her sister Jane Pinto, who live in Fraser Town, said the city's polluted air depresses them. 
""But orchids help us get over it; they bring clean air to the house,"" they added. Encyclia, dendrobium, cymbidium, cycnoches, cattleya and several other species were sold at the show at prices ranging from Rs 400 to Rs 2,000.Feel of positivityThough the horticulture department doesn't maintain any data on cultivation of orchids in the state, Sadananda Hegde, president of The Orchid Society of Karnataka (TOSKAR), says the demand for orchids has increased over the past five years in Bengaluru. ""Compared to the response we received at the first orchid show in 2012, this year we saw almost 40% more business. Also, the number of people taking up orchid business is growing. Earlier, a majority of exhibitors was from Kerala, but now we see entrepreneurs from Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka,"" he added. The orchid society had just four members to start with in 2005 and the number has now grown to650. According to Hegde, many startups in the city are also exploring the potential of orchid business.Mamta Bargale, director and co-founder of Enticing Flowers Pvt Ltd, said they courier orchids across the country. ""When we started selling orchids six years ago, the demand was low. But now we see a lot of Bengalureans who want orchids at home for a 'positive feel'. We have expanded cultivation and outlets over the last few years,"" she added.Though orchid cultivation is yet to thrive as an industry, the growers feel there is a huge demand. Dr SV Hattimani, retired additional director of horticulture department, said various species of orchids are grown in Malnad and coastal regions. Kerala is doing well with orchid cultivation and Karnataka too has a lot of scope, but there's less awareness. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Sharp rise in patients with breathing problems this week,The Times of India (TOI),11-10-2018,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: There is a 50% rise in number of patients reporting to the city's hospitals with ailments and allergies related to increase in air pollution, which further worsened after fire crackers were burst on Diwali. Though the Supreme Court had fixed a two-hour window between 8-10 pm for bursting only green firecrackers on Diwali, both directives were openly flouted in Gurugram on Wednesday. Track the pollution level in your cityDr Kajal Kumud, physician at Civil Hospital, said, ""There was a 50% increase in patient footfall, especially of those with breathing problems including asthma, at the hospital in the past week. 
On Thursday, there was a long queue of patients who complained of running nose, burning eyes, wheezing, repeated cough, etc, mainly due to inhaling air polluted with emission from firecrackers.""New patients are coming up with adult onset asthma, which earlier was earlier a rarity, he added. This condition occurs when adults above 20 years of age are diagnosed with asthma for the first time. ""Besides witnessing patients with exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, many new patients with adult onset asthma, which was a rarity before, are coming to us. Elderly people were affected the most by higher air and noise pollution, which has aggravated respiratory and auditory problems,"" said Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant, pulmonology, Paras Hospital.Kumar added that despite the Supreme Court guidelines for Diwali, air quality index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR crossed the 900 mark with dangerously high PM2.5 levels, which is hazardous to health. He said he expects further rise in cases of pulmonary infections and other problems like skin allergies and eye infections.""Dr Neetu Talwar, paediatric pulmonologist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, ""Pollution in winters has worsened. Respiratory problems in children and risks of viral illnesses is higher, as they are more vulnerable and go to schools or daycare or crches, where transmission between children increases. Smog tends to settle down with air pollutants and children inhale these in greater amount. We have seen increase in footfall since Diwali, probably due to worse AQI.""

'AQI likely to get better after 48 hours',The Times of India (TOI),11-09-2018,PATNA,"PATNA: The state capital witnessed a sharp rise in the air pollution level with a surge in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Diwali on Wednesday.According to Sameer app of the Central Pollution Control Board (CBPCB), the AQI increased from 373 at 4pm on Wednesday to 420 at 8am on Thursday, which falls under the 'severe' category. It can badly affect healthy people and those with existing diseases.The CPCB stated that Patna's AQI was 334 on the eve of Diwali on Tuesday. The worsening of air quality began on Wednesday with large-scale bursting of firecrackers and other meteorological conditions.Despite the Supreme Court's restrictions on bursting of crackers from 8pm to 10pm this Diwali, the AQI was 373 at 4pm on Wednesday and 388 at 11pm, an hour after the end of the two-hour window.Experts claimed that meteorological factors such as drop in temperature, increase in moisture and decline in wind speed also formed favourable conditions for trapping of pollutants in Patna's air.""The temperature dropped to 17 degrees C at 11pm on Wednesday, while the humidity was 84% that led to an increase in moisture and trapping of pollutants. 
The wind, which was blowing at a speed of 8km per hour on Tuesday became calm. These factors made the dispersal of pollutants more difficult,"" said a duty officer at the Patna Meteorological Centre.He added, ""Meteorological factors played a secondary role in Patna's air pollution on Diwali.

"Paddy burning in Punjab, Haryana behind rise in west Uttar Pradesh pollution, say experts",The Times of India (TOI),11-01-2018,MEERUT,"MEERUT/AGRA: In the recent air quality monitoring data released by the Central Pollution Control Board, 10 out of 12 most polluted cities of the country are in Uttar Pradesh, most of them western part of the state. While NASA data has revealed that number of crop fires in Punjab-Haryana has shot up dramatically in the past two days, experts here said that paddy straw, stubble burning in many parts of Haryana, Punjab and west UP districts have contributed to rising pollution levels. According to GC Verma, regional officer, Pollution Control Board, Bijnor, ""Since this region borders Haryana and the air blows from west to east, a considerable amount of air pollution gets transferred from neighbouring states to western UP as burning of paddy waste is rampant there.""Besides, the region itself contributes to air pollution since more than 2.6 lakh hectares is under paddy cultivation here. 
According to N Subhash, principal scientist, agriculture meteorology, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University, ""Ever since mechanized methods have been employed in the farmlands to segregate straw from the harvested crop, a great amount of collected straw is burned in the fields. Though in west UP, a considerable amount of straw is used for cattle fodder, yet the level of pollution has risen.""On Tuesday, Anita Meshram, division commissioner of Meerut zone which comprises Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Baghpat, held an emergency meeting of the regional officers of pollution control boards and directed them to take stringent measures to curb pollution. ""From November 1 to November 10, all industrial activities including construction work, stone crushing, furnaces using conventional fuels will be shut down. Besides, diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol driven ones more than 15 years will be seized. A graded fine system has also been invoked against farmers who burn paddy waste in their fields,"" Meshram told TOI.Another reason that experts attribute to increased pollution in this region is the slow wind speed and substantial decrease in temperature.""This condition is really dangerous for cardiac patients or those on the borderline as during very low temperatures, arterial circulation contracts leading to cardiac arrests especially in the elderly. There is almost 300% rise in emergency departments of hospitals. Besides, when the pollutants enter lungs, they work as irritants that trigger the formation of phlegm in the walls of lungs. Consequently, body is unable to release toxins like carbon dioxide and this leads to drowsiness in acute cases,"" said pulmonologist Dr Veerottam Tomar in Meerut.In Agra, pediatrician Dr Sharad Gupta said children are at a greater risk. ""They are falling victim to various forms of allergies,"" he added. On Tuesday, in the Central Pollution Control Board's Air Quality Index Chart Baghpat was the most polluted city in the country and fell in 'severe' category with 401 index value while Agra was second most polluted one with 354. This is out of 12 most polluted cities in the entire country. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

The proposed AQI will consider eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb) for which short-term (up to 24-hourly averaging period) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its 24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health breakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Severe air quality sparks emergency meet,The Times of India (TOI),12-12-2018,DELHI,"New Delhi: Delhi's air quality remained 'severe' on Tuesday with the overall air quality index (AQI) rising further by the evening due to low wind speed, forcing agencies like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) taskforce to carry out an emergency meeting. Delhi's overall AQI which was classified at 403 (severe) on Monday, had risen to 413 on Tuesday and CPCB has issued directions to corporations and other agencies to carry out a strong drive in pollution hotspots around the capital.Forecasts by IMD show Delhi is likely to have an improvement from Thursday as wind speed increases. However, CPCB said localised action will begin immediately to prevent air quality from deteriorating .""We have received information from IMD that strong winds will start blowing from Thursday and until then we have started drives at all locations in Delhi NCR where air quality is severe. While vigilance will be all around Delhi NCR, special focus will be given to these hotspots where activities may cause a spike in air pollution,"" said a senior CPCB official.

Killer rat-hole mines ruin ecology too,The Times of India (TOI),12/24/2018,GUWAHATI,"Almost a week after Sayeb Ali, 21, survived after being trapped in an illegal 'rat-hole' coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, he is constantly hounded by a feeling of guilt - that he helplessly saw his fellow-miners being engulfed by water that flooded the 350-foot-deep mine. Fourteen people are still trapped inside the pit since December 13. They have the slimmest chance of survival even as rescue operations are on. ""I survived, but seeing family members of my friends who couldn't make it causes me pain. Images of my friends who were in the pit hounds me,"" says Sayeb, who earns Rs 2,000 per day in the mines, money which he can never hope to get in any other job. 
The money comes with danger, and there is no health insurance or other cover for a job which poses such hazards to health and life. This is just the latest accident after the National Green Tribunal's ban on rat-hole mining in the state on April 17, 2014. In 2012, at least 15 persons were trapped inside a rat-hole mine in Nangalbibra of South Garo Hills. No one knows what happened to them. Since then, several mine collapses have occurred. Many of the casualties have gone unreported because of the clandestine nature of coal mining. According to activists, in case of accidents involving migrant miners, the people running the operation simply hush things up.Activist Angela Rangad told TOI, ""Heightened criminality has meant such accidents go unreported and local administration and police are not proactive. Perhaps this time it received attention because some of the miners trapped inside were locals."" Even CM Conrad Sangma admitted that after the Ksan disaster, illegal mining was a flourishing business. ""It is difficult to keep a foolproof check on illegal mining, but district administrations have been asked to step up their vigil,"" he said.Meanwhile, criminal elements associated with the illegal mining business have become increasingly aggressive. On November 8, Civil Society Women's Organisation president Agnes Kharshiing and her associate Amita Sangma were injured in an attack by goons at Sohshrieh in East Jaintia Hills district. Agnes and Amita were taking photographs of trucks being loaded with coal from rat-hole mines when they were attacked. An RTI activist, Popynhum Majaw, was murdered in Khliehriat, a coal mining hub, in March this year. ""They left us for dead on the road. The attack cannot silence us,"" Amita said. In Meghalaya, coal mines are privately owned. In the predominantly tribal state, communities own land and have rights over resources. But because of the lucrative returns from coal mining that is also said to be one of the chief revenue sources for the government, community-owned lands are increasingly being privatised and used for non-agricultural activities like coal mining. This has triggered unabated extraction of coal through rat-holes which range between 5 and 100 sq m of vertical pits, branching into networks of horizontal channels, which are at constant risk of caving in or flooding. According to some activists, the process has exploded since the 1970s, at the cost of human lives and the environment. Ministers and MLAs across party lines in the state government are mine owners. The state's politics is enmeshed with the mining issue, which became a pivotal topic during the assembly elections earlier this year. The 2014 ban, during Congress rule, faced stiff resistance from mine owners. BJP and its ally NPP, which eventually won elections, promised to find a solution through ""scientific mining"". The fallout of mining operations can be seen in the environment as well. The 2014 ban by NGT was based on a petition filed by All Dimasa Students' Union after water of Kopili river in Assam allegedly turning acidic due to seepage of chemicals from coal mines in the Jaintia Hills.A water quality report in coal mining areas of the state by a team from North-Eastern Hill University in Shillong pointed out that in Jaintia Hills large scale forest denudation, scarcity of water, pollution of air, water and soil and degradation of agricultural lands ""are some of the conspicuous environmental implications of coal mining"".

"Priests stress on issues from harmony to pollution, say laughter is the best medicine",The Times of India (TOI),12/27/2018,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: Priests leading the mass at various city churches on Christmas morning spoke to the congregation about several issues affecting the citizens - ranging from communal harmony to rising air pollution.""We will be able to respect our own religion if we learn to respect that of others,"" said Rev Biswajit Biswas of Duff Church who believes laughter is the best medicine for woes in the years ahead and highlighted the inclusive nature of the City of Joy.Christmas day at the Duff Church was exquisite - with a mild breeze, traditional decoration and a large turnout of the faithful in their best finery. The service started with hymns and Verses 3:7 from Chapter 3 of the Book of Titus. They were carefully picked to explain the futility of disharmony between various religions. 
The birth of Christ was also spoken on, through the Book of Micah.Reverend Biswas, who led the Duff Church congregation, said: ""The fabric of my robe was purchased from a Sikh. A Muslim tailor stitched it. For the society to grow and prosper, we have to coexist,"" he remarked, adding that he could not recite Hindu chants with such clarity or sing the azaan with as much zeal but respected both the persons who pursued their religion with faith.At the Church of Christ the King, the priest, Vincient Lobo, also urged the congregation to help people irrespective of which community they belonged to.""Education is important for it makes a person wise and helps one overcome fear, mistrust and suspicion of another religion,"" he said, praising chief minister Mamata Banerjee for the government's efforts to maintain communal harmony.He also thanked the government for the cordial relations it had maintained with the Catholic church.""The state has illuminated the Bandel Church. It had also bought land for the Catholic Church in the city,"" he said. The celebrations at the church began with Christmas carols. The mass that followed focused on the gospel of St John and dwelt on the incarnation and divinity of Christ.The Church of Christ the King also arranged supper for 800 poor and less fortunate people in the afternoon.In the past few weeks, the air quality in the city has dipped beyond the normal levels forcing everybody to sit up and take note of the situation. At several churches, the clergy stressed on the importance of focussing on environmental issues. At St Andrew's Church on Brabourne Road, Reverend Swarup Bar addressed the congregation.""Jesus was born in a stable which is not the cleanliest of places. The world we stay in is faced with the problem of pollution but we can fight it. We must resolve that we will hand over a better place to the generations to come,"" said Bar.By- Samriddhi Nandi & Sanyantan Sarkar For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

IS YOUR PET GASPING NOW?,The Times of India (TOI),12-10-2018,PEOPLE,"Friday was the cruellest day for pets in Kolkata. That's the day the city breathed the foulest air this year. On Friday, the air quality index (AQI) recorded at the automatic pollution monitoring station at the RBU campus on BT Road had shown results that shocked pet owners. The AQI had read 434. That was way above the 409 reading on Diwali night. 
While humans could wear masks to avoid the hazard, ever wondered how our furry friends are dealing with the air pollution? Keeping the pooch indoors is an option but then again, it impacts their exercise regime.Actor Dev, who has two pets, one American Akita and a Cane Corso, said, ""After reading the TOI report on pollution this Saturday, I'm worried about their health. Things are only getting worse by the day. So, I've to keep them indoors. But will that be a permanent solution?"" CT checks out the precautions needed to take care of the furry and feathered friends during these difficult times.DogsBelieve it or not, dogs are more affected by air pollution than human beings. Besides, they cannot communicate about their illness. That increases the risk of things getting out of hand soon. While vehicular smoke is the most harmful, there are other kinds of smoke that affect them too. According to Dr Gautam Banerjee, a noted vet in Kolkata, since dogs have a higher breathing rate, pollutants like carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide enter their bodies more. ""Walking is a necessity for pets. In Kolkata, where both traffic and pollution are on the rise, taking your pet out for a walk is cumbersome and might affect your pooch's health,"" he said.SymptomsCoughing or gagging, difficulty in breathing (including open-mouth breathing and increased noise while breathing), eye irritation, excessive watering, inflammation of throat or mouth, nasal discharge, asthma-like symptoms and increased breathing rates are common. Rahul Nag, a pet parent to a German Shephard, said, ""Dogs have a very sensitive system. On Diwali, I saw my dog constantly coughing and trying to clear his throat. After two hours, I took him to a vet and learnt that the fumes were creating the problem. We can wear masks and stay indoors to avoid outdoor pollution. Pets don't have that option. So it is our duty to save them from pollution.""RemediesIf your dog experiences any of these symptoms, it is advisable to take him/her to the vet immediately. A dog would need some amount of daily exercise. While most experts suggest daily walks, it is counter-effective and even harmful for the dog to exercise now that the pollution level is so high. According to Dr Santanu Mukherjee, the water intake must be increased during this time to flush out pollutants from their bodies. ""Besides, pet owners must not take their dogs for a walk during the peak office hours or when the pollution level and smog are high,"" he said, suggesting that owners play with the dogs indoors. ""I recommend using a ball tied to a rope to play with the dogs at home,"" Santanu said.BirdsThere was a time when American coal miners used caged canaries as a natural carbon monoxide and methane detection system. If the birds perished or became notably distressed, it meant a serious hazard. That was a sign for immediate evacuation. Birds are very vulnerable to pollution since they have higher breathing rates and complex respiratory systems. When they are exposed to pollution in the open, birds often change their location to avoid it. ""In the morning, dry leaves and litter are often set on fire. If you minutely inspect, you won't be able to spot a single bird around in that smoky zone,"" said veterinary doctor Sidharta Ghosh. However, in captivity, the birds do not have that freedom.SymptomsLoss of weight and feather, vomiting, short breathing and mucus in the nostril. Increasing pollution often triggers various lung infections including pneumonia, respiratory diseases and pulmonary infections. Dhritiman Datta, a breeder of exotic parrots, said noise pollution can lead to heart attack. ""Breeding problems can surface too. Birds have this habit of throwing away their eggs from their nests if they are irritated by air pollution. Lung problems and heavy metal poisoning can also occur if the air pollution rate is high,"" Dhritiman said.RemediesThe precautions depend entirely on the set-up you have. If you have a small cage of birds, then place it indoor. Since sunlight and air are necessities for birds, place the cage outside once or twice in a day when the pollution level isn't high. Though there is no robust medical study to suggest that air purifiers work according to the claims made by the companies selling them, there is no harm in using one. If you have a big cage or a room full of birds, you can try using an air-purifier indoor.CatsPet cats are known to suffer health hazards from chemical pollution in the environment, often earlier than humans. Way back in 1950s, neurobehavioral symptoms were first observed in cats that consumed mercury-contaminated fish in Japan's Minamata Bay. The disturbed behaviour of suffering animals was then dubbed by locals as ""dancing cat fever"". With increasing pollution levels in Kolkata, cats are battling various kinds of problems. Modhumanti Das, who adopted three stray cats, said, ""Cats are sensitive to smoke. If you have a cat at home, avoid doing any kind of puja in the room with agarbatti and diya. Also, one should avoid smoking in front of them.""SymptomsMany of the symptoms are similar to what is seen among dogs. So, there is coughing, difficulty in breathing, eye irritation and excessive watering, nasal discharge and increased breathing rates. Besides, there will be bad odour at home if a cat is unwell. According to Dr Gautam Banerjee, a cat suffers skin problems too. ""They have a kind of asthma that is difficult to cure in Kolkata. The white fur gets discoloured too,"" he said.RemediesIf your cat is experiencing any of these symptoms for longer than three hours, take him/her to the vet immediately. According to Debesh Sandhuka, the owner of an Indian stray cat and a Persian cat, ""There is a difference in behaviour between my two cats. The Persian cat likes to stay indoors. But the stray cat goes around in the neighbourhood at least twice or thrice a day. During the monsoon and on days when pollution levels are high, we try to keep him indoors.""

NTPC begins using farm stubble as fuel at Dadri plant to help Delhi breathe easy,The Times of India (TOI),1/15/2019,INDIA,"NEW DELHI: State-run NTPC has started using farm stubble as fuel at one of the units at its Dadri power plant, a first of its kind move expected to help Delhi and its neighbourhood breathe easy by stopping farmers from burning crop residue - a major contributor to winter smog - and supplementing farm income as well as creating rural jobs.""We (the Modi government) have done what we have said. It is helping the environment. It is helping the farmers by giving them additional revenue. 
It is developing an ecosystem of rural entrepreneurs and start-ups,"" power minister R K Singh told TOI on phone from Abu Dhabi, where he is attending an international renewable energy conference.Known as 'biomass' co-firing in industry parlance, it is possible to mix farm residue pellets with coal up to 10% of the total fuel used in a power plant without affecting heating efficiency or tariff. Usually, residue that is least preferred as cattle fodder and burnt by farmers are used to make pellets.The power ministry had announced the step in November 2017 when north India was reeling under bad spell of smog produced by crop burning in the entire region. ""On an average, one acre of cropping yields about two tonne of stubble or straw... NTPC will buy stubble at Rs 5,500 per tonne, which will yield an additional income of approximately Rs 11,000 per acre for farmers,"" Singh had said while announcing the policy on November 16, 2017.Though details of price or quantity being used at Dadri were not available, company sources said NTPC is expanding the move to its other power plants as well but it will take some time to establish a regular supply chain of pellets.NTPC has invited EOI (expression of interest) for sourcing pellets for its power plants across the country and will hold a workshop to train them on the new entrepreneurial avenue before calling for bids. This is expected to encourage the collection and storage of agricultural residue and spur investments in facilities for manufacturing pellets.Company sources said ash generated from the burning of agro residue-based fuel in power plants get absorbed in electrostatic precipitators and does not cause air pollution. Also, the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emitted from their combustion is absorbed in the next crop cycle by photosynthesis, which does not increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

"On 1st morning of new year, Kolkata breathes in poison",The Times of India (TOI),01-03-2019,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: If morning shows the day, the PM2.5 count on the first morning of the year is an ominous forecast of what lies ahead. The count for ultra-fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers on January 1hovered in the severe category all day and averaged 402, six times the permissible limit.New Year's Eve celebrations played a part in the spike in PM2.5 count with indiscriminate use of fireworks from 11.30 pm to 1am and beyond releasing huge amounts of particulate matter in the air. This is identical to what happened in early November, when bursting of firecrackers on Kali Puja and Diwali nights led to the spiralling of PM2.5 count that remained high till mid-December. With no major change forecast in the city's weather, residents may have to battle the effects of severe pollution for all of January, and perhaps, even February.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) that predicts weather condition and its impact on pollution in major Indian cities, had on Monday issued a warning that any new trigger, particularly due to 'open fire and pyrotechnic display (firecrackers)', will make the air heavier and thicker leading to rapid deterioration in air quality to severe-plus range.Experts rue lack of publicity of SC directiveEnvironment activists noted with concern the lack of publicity and indiscriminate violation of the Supreme Court order restricting fireworks between 11.55pm and 12.30am in New Year-related celebration on December 31 and January 1. ""The spike in air pollution during this time is routine. 
But pollution of this level is unprecedented. The situation warrants graded response action plan (GRAP) from the pollution controlling authority - West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB). But the integrated action plan, including preventive and controlling action, has been unfortunately missing,"" said Biswajit Mukherjee, former law officer at WBPCB and a passionate environmentalist.Environment crusader Subhas Datta, too, expressed fear that the blatant violation of the SC order would have a snowballing effect on Kolkata's residents. ""The city will suffer for at least a month for this one night's mad celebration,"" he rued.On the first day of year, the hourly PM2.5 count at air quality monitoring station at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) off BT Road in north Kolkata hovered around 500-mark between midnight and 2 am. Thereafter, it stayed close to the 400-mark. Even the air quality monitoring station at Victoria Memorial Hall, which shows the best available air quality in the city, never plunged belo 350.Fireworks apart, burning of waste - both for warmth and to avoid disposal - added to the pollution. Realising the need to act, Kolkata Police on Monday had announced a ban on waste burning, a move that has been welcomed by environmentalists. But they call for more measures like ban on entry of trucks into the city to help bring down the PM2.5 count.""New pollutants are piling up on already poor air quality we are inheriting from the previous day. We need urgent measures like Delhi adopts to again bring down the pollution level to a reasonable level,"" said auto emission consultant Somendra Mohan Ghosh.In December, air quality index was severe on seven days, very poor on 21 day and poor for just a day. It was moderate on December 18 and 19, thanks to untimely rain. ""This is the worst ever December as far as city's air quality goes. There is no room for complacency that we are better than Delhi. In fact, in most of the days, we are far worse than Delhi,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air, a platform for environmentalists and activists. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Submit reports on anti-pollution steps twice a week, state body told",The Times of India (TOI),1/18/2019,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to submit reports on anti-pollution measures enforced in the city, twice a week - on Tuesday and Friday. ""The HSPCB has been directed to submit the action-taken reports on complaints on air pollution, illegal dumping of construction waste, burning of municipal solid waste, operation of illegal industries, penalty levied and prosecution filed in the court for violations related to construction and demolition activities, pollution control regulations for industries and use of diesel gensets,"" states a letter issued by CPCB to HSPCB.According to a report submitted by CPCB's task force in December, 85 pollution rule violations have been reported in the city. Of 85, around 22 cases of open dumping of garbage and 10 garbage burning cases were reported. 
Other complaints highlighted violations of construction norms, dumping of construction and demolition waste, industrial emissions, road dust and vehicular emissions. The violations were recorded during 12 field visits by the team between December 1 and December 31. All the violations observed by the team were sent to civic agencies and HSPCB via Sameer app.The HSPCB has to submit an action-taken report within a week for the month of December. Moreover, regular reports will be filed by the HSPCB every Tuesday and Friday of a week.Air quality deteriorates as wind speed and temperature go down. The city's air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels on Wednesday from 'moderate' level on Tuesday owing to a sharp decline in wind speed and temperature during the night. The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 304 (very poor) on Wednesday, while it was 139 (moderate) on Tuesday and 221 (poor) on Monday. The 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5, which was recorded at 66 micrograms per cubic metre on Tuesday and 118 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday, increased to 218 micrograms per cubic metre on Wednesday. The AQI in all other NCR cities was also 'very poor'. While Delhi's AQI was recorded at 371, Faridabad recorded it at 328, Ghaziabad at 384, Noida at 356 and Greater Noida at 356. Manesar's AQI was recorded at 271 (poor).Expect cold wave to continueCold wave conditions at isolated pockets are likely to occur on Thursday in the region, according to the India Meteorological Department. The minimum temperature in Gurugram dropped to 4.9C on Wednesday, three notches below the season's average. According to the Met department, cold winds from the northwest have hit Delhi-NCR, triggering a drop in the temperatures. ""Cold winds are likely to be in the region for at least two-three days. As the temperature is dropping and a decline has been noticed in the wind speed, the region saw a deterioration of air quality on Wednesday,"" said a Met official.

"RTA proposes permits for 2,000 electric autos in city",The Times of India (TOI),1/28/2019,KOCHI,"Kochi: The Road Transport Authority (RTA) has plans to issue fresh permits to electric/ CNG autorickshaws in a bid to phase out autos using fossil fuels.The meeting held on January 19 put forward the suggestion to allot 2,000 permits for electric autos and 1,000 for CNG/LPG-fuelled autos in the city. District collector, city police commissioner and deputy transport commissioner will take a final call in this regard soon. ""The promotion of electric and LPG/CNG-fuelled vehicles is the policy of the state government. 
We are placing the decision of the government in RTA comprising collector, commissioner and deputy transport commissioner,"" a motor vehicles department official said.For the last 10 years, the motor vehicles department has not been giving new permit for autos in the city. Now, RTO gives fitness certificate for autos that convert into electric/CNG/LPG autos.Transport officials said there are more takers for CNG autos in the city and they receive more requests to convert diesel autos into CNG-powered ones, which are less polluting compared to fossil-fuelled ones. However, the registration of electric autos is yet to start in the city.""Most of the autorickshaw drivers are encouraged to convert into CNG since it gives more profit to the drivers. Pollution, both air and sound, is less compared to diesel. Below 1,000 CNG autos ply in the city now,"" said Semantha Bhadran of auto drivers' union. Now, around 10,000 autos operate in Kochi and most of them are from suburbs of the city.CNG-powered vehicles also get good mileage, which is another factor luring drivers. ""After conversion into CNG, my auto is having a mileage of 40km/litre, while it was 30km/ltr in diesel auto. Officials should take up the matter of installing CNG pumps in the city immediately,"" said Varghese, an auto driver.The drivers of the CNG autos lament over the absence of CNG pumps in the city as they have to ply either to Muttom or to Kundanoor to refill the tanks. They also raise concern over rising price of the CNG.""CNG is a good option. When I converted my vehicle from diesel to CNG eight months ago, the price of the latter was Rs 47.47. Now it rose to Rs 53.12. But the problem we are facing is the absence of CNG pumps in the city. I conduct service from Palarivattom. I have to drive to either Muttom or Kundannoor to refill the tank; I have to travel extra 20km in both ways. Setting up CNG pumps in the city is an important matter, which the officials should take up on a war footing,"" said K R Saji, a driver. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Meet the authors writing debut novels in their 80s,The Times of India (TOI),2/13/2019,INDIA,"Shukla Lal's daughter would often find her squinting at her phone early in the morning. She'd tell her mother, who had just turned 80, not to be on her phone when she had barely woken up. Turns out, Lal wasn't just sending good morning messages to family members - she was writing. ""It started with poems,"" Lal says. 
""I wrote 29 nazms in the space of a month. I would be inspired by something, like watching a tree shed leaves or a house being dismantled, and the words would just flow out of me.""Her collection of poems was followed by a novel about a partition-era love story, which she wrote in the span of three months. And after that novel? Well, she wrote another - this time it was 'Floating Logs', a historical romance book set in the Calcutta of her youth. Lal, now 82 and working on her third manuscript, compares the flood of writing to a ""vertical avalanche"" of inspiration.Lal may be unique in the sense that writing seems to be a meditative experience for her, but she isn't the only Indian author who has penned their first book at an older age. Jharna Banerji, 82, began writing her novel, 'Perched on the Periphery,' while her husband was ailing with Parkinson's disease. Her book is about an older widow who has been made to immigrate to live with her children, and how she grapples with finding her own identity. ""It took me a long 10 years to write this book as I was a full-time caregiver and a spare time raconteur of this tale. The process of writing was cathartic, because when you write you are never alone or lonely,"" says Banerji, who started writing the book at 65.Older authors have a wealth of experience, at a basic level, simply because of the changes they seen. Inspired by her reflections about how much India has changed since she was a child, Lal enjoys writing historical romance novels. They combine her inherently romantic nature with her desire to bring people into the India she grew up in. ""The post-Partition India where my kids grew up was peaceful. There was a strong awareness of and respect for other communities. I wanted to convey that harmony,"" she says.Banerji agrees with the idea that being older gives one valuable perspective. ""I feel that having such a broad spectrum experience of life as the elderly do, if they can remain rational, and see the past and the present in a balanced manner, then they have the wherewithal to do wonders with it,"" says the Pune resident.For others, post-retirement life allows them the opportunity to look back not only at the way the world has evolved, but also at their own careers and accomplishments. For Kiran Doshi, 80, it took retiring from the IFS to start writing about his experiences. 'Birds of Passage,' his first book, was a satirical look at diplomatic circles set in the world of India-Pakistan-US relations. His most recent book 'Jinnah Often Came to Our House' is a fictionalised account asking the question, ""Why is it so difficult to improve our relations with Pakistan?""Reflecting on his decision to start writing fiction after retiring he says, ""As a career diplomat I had to write a lot all my working life. Yet I have no doubt that if I had started writing fiction when I was much younger, I would have become more skillful at it by the time I turned 60."" While that may be the case, he adds, ""What the older writer says has greater depth, I feel. The reason? He can see more.""Parth Mehrotra, commissioning editor of publishing house Juggernaut, says, ""Especially in non-fiction, an older author brings a lifetime of experience. A journalist or a civil servant or a politician or a doctor, looking back on their career can have invaluable insights.""Kamal Meattle, 74, is perhaps the ultimate exemplification of this kind of non-fiction writing. His book, 'How to Grow Fresh Air,' is about his work as an environmentalist, specifically in air pollution management. He reflects on how he tackled pollution in Delhi and offers solutions to readers about how they can better the air they breathe.Meattle was inspired by his younger son who compared him to an Ayurveda who has found a solution for himself but won't share it with others. ""In the 1990s, I became allergic to Delhi's air and the doctors told me to leave. I would go away and be OK, but as soon as I came back, there would be problems,"" he says. ""My friends are here, my life is here, why would I want to disappear?"" So, instead, he focused on finding his own solutions, including a cleaning system he installed in his Nehru Place office. He adds: ""The idea behind the book was to use simple language to help people help themselves"" Meattle is now working on a similar book geared towards children.For many, getting older means finally having the time to pursue writing with the dedication their busy lives didn't allow. Lal says, ""I couldn't write earlier because I had so much on my hands. At this age, my mind is free, so why not write?"" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Is air pollution becoming too big a health menace in the city?,The Times of India (TOI),2/24/2019,BHUBANESWAR EVENTS,"Sandip.Bal@timesgroup.comTaking a walk and breathing in fresh air is fast becoming a dream for residents of the twin cities. Bhubaneswar may have earned a smart city tag, but its residents are being exposed ever-increasing levels of pollution with each passing day. Though the situation is not as bad as in the metros, the city's air quality index reveals a picture that's disturbing to say the least. 
The air quality that used to fluctuate between moderately polluted in November and satisfactory in April, now reads very poor at several places in the city. A real-time air quality index (AQI) displayed at PMG Square showed that at least four of the seven places recorded AQI above 300, which is very poor. What makes matters worse?In November last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had written to the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) seeking plans to curb air pollution in six cities in the state that are among 102 cities across the country with poor air quality. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are two of the six cities from the state.Suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels are quite high in air, especially in winter. It's the respirable suspended particulate matters (RSPM) with a diameter less than or equal to 10 micron that create problems. When inhaled these particles create respiratory complications. ""We found the RSPM or the PM10 particles in abundance in Bhubaneswar and much beyond the standard of 100 microgram per cubic metre. The level crosses 300 micrograms at various places during different times in the year,"" informed Saswat Mohanty, an environmentalist.Reasons aplentyAccording to officials of the Odisha State Pollution Control Board, reasons for air pollution are vehicular emission, road dust, industrial pollution and pollution from construction and demolition work. ""There has been a huge increase in the number of vehicles on the roads in the past few years. Besides, there are regular construction work and road work,"" said Sanghamitra Swain, an environmental scientist. She added rapid urbanisation of the outskirts and clearing of forest covers also contribute to the same.Curbing the menaceAuthorities have installed display boards at different places in the city, which provides real-time data on air quality. These display boards extract data from sensors installed by SPCB at various places. ""The collected data has been helping us analyse the air quality of those areas and steps are taken to curb the pollution,"" said a smart city official, adding, ""Commuting on bicycles is a step taken forward. Public transport is also the focal point. Roadside plantations and amusement parks are made.""Residents join handsFor the city people, it's good that the authorities are showing the way forward. ""We need to promote such eco-friendly and cheap measures for transport to reduce pollution,"" said Manoj Das, a private company employee and a cycling enthusiast.Ambient Air Quality Index at different places in the city on FridayInfocity 280KIIT Square 311Kalinga Hospital Square 298IRC Village 302Mancheswar 289DAV Unit-8 area 330Master Canteen 308(Photos by Subhranshu Mohapatra) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

MPCB notices to 30 coal depots for violating env norms,The Times of India (TOI),02-01-2019,NAGPUR,"Chandrapur: In a strong move to rein in pollution caused by coal depots, Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has issued show cause notices to 30 depots, warning them of legal action for violating standards of air, water and hazardous waste pollution control. All the depots also seem to be operating without MPCB consent.MPCB sources informed that there are over 30 coal depots operating in areas close to Padoli, Nagala, Nagpur Road, Ghugus Road, Mahakulra and Dhanora phata on the stretch between Chandrapur and Ghugus. The notices have been served following multiple complaints lodged by villagers, political leaders and RTI activists. 
The notices have accused them of operating in violation of MPCB's notification dated August 26, 2016. It is obligatory on the part of all coal depots to provide adequate air and water pollution arrangements, and to operate and maintain it to achieve the prescribed standard. However, site inspection has revealed manifold violation of pollution control norms in each unit. The coal depots served with the notices, copies of which TOI has, have been charged with illegal operation without seeking consent from MPCB. None of these depots have installed ambient air quality monitoring station, nor carried out any meteorological study nor erected any plant to control dust particles.Most of the units also lack mandatory compound wall of 3m height along its periphery to break the wind. Even those having compound wall do not comply with the 3m standard at some places. Spot inspection revealed that there are no storm water drains and storage is not in demarcated compartmentalized area.There are no silos for material storage and none of the depots provides mandatory closed-type coal transportation from their premises. MPCB has also charged the depots with violation of provisions under Water (prevention and control of pollution) Act-1974 and Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act-1981. These depots have been directed to submit their reply within 7 days explaining why legal action should not be initiated against them.A MPCB officer maintained that it is difficult to take action against these illegal coal depots. He explained that every new industry requires water supply and power supply connection. And when they approach these authorities, they are asked to bring MPCB consent. However, in case of coal depots, they neither need power nor water supply to start their operations. Hence, most coal depots have not bothered to approach the board for mandatory consent.""Even if we order closure of these depots, we cannot force it, as they have no power or water supply to disconnect,"" he explained.As all these depots are illegal, MPCB does not have any bank guarantee of these units to forfeit. Even if they are forced to close down, there is all the possibility of their owners shifting the site to some other location and starting operating illegally again. The officer, however, maintained that if coal depots fail to comply with pollution standards and explain their stand, board officials will have to seek district administration help to force their compliance or closure.

Smart Surat struggling to breathe easy,The Times of India (TOI),3/22/2019,SURAT,"Surat: Toxic fumes released by the high number of vehicles everyday, coupled with the smoke from dyeing and printing units, is turning the air around Surat city's commercial areas unbreathable. The city, mainly those parts under industrial segments, are forced to survive in an atmosphere polluted with suspended particulate matter (PM) 2.5 mm and PM 10 mm, said GPCB officials.With a population count of more than 50 lakh, Surat city - the eighth-most populated city of the country at present - has 31 lakh vehicles of all sizes and 5,000 km roads. With Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) continuously monitoring the levels of air pollution at 10 different spots round the year, the city has fallen from its earlier 'good' position owing to the dip in its air quality to 'moderately polluted' category according to National Air Quality Index (AQI) . Experts fear that if the pollution continues to grow at this rate it will take less than 3 years for the city to reach 'poor' to 'very poor' levels as per AQI standards. 
Surat's phenomenal rise in vehicular population - addition of 1.5 million vehicles in a decade - is the root cause of deterioration in air quality. Recently, the World Bank officials too expressed their fears on the rising pollution levels, especially PM10mg |M3 and PM2.5 mg|M3, in the city. Dr Namrata Jariwala, an expert in pollution and environment issues from Sardar Vallbhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), however, does not blame vehicles alone for the pollution. ""Apart from increase in number of vehicles, there is also the emissions from industrial units for the fuel type they use,"" she said. When compared to highly polluted cities like Delhi, Surat too has high pollution levels that is visible from a filter paper turning black in two hours even at spots like Piplod, she explained. ""However, what helps Surat still breathe easy is its climatic conditions. In winter such pollutants can cause eye irritation or running nose or throat infection but apart from local irritants, we do not feel higher impact of pollution. Compared to hot places like Delhi, we live in 10-15 degree Celsius which helps pollutants to disperse easily,"" she said.Parag Dave, regional officer at GPCB, Surat, said, ""Ongoing construction activity, demolition work sites, bigger project sites, vehicle emissions are some of the things that increase pollutants in air along with hydrocarbon emissions due to different types of machines. We need to control such construction activities along with number of vehicles plying in residential areas of the city."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"SMC plans to borrow Rs1,925 crore from World Bank",The Times of India (TOI),03-03-2019,SURAT,"Surat: The standing committee of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has approved a proposal to procure loan of Rs1,925 crore from World Bank. The money will be used on pollution-free development projects and also to conduct a study along with Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI) and Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) on pollution in the city.Jawalant Naik, environment engineer, SMC, told TOI, ""SMC will need money from a financial body like World Bank to undertake a number of development projects in 2019-21. The standing committee has approved the proposal and hence we will beginning the loan procurement process soon. We have identified projects in different segments in which SMC's contribution will be around 20 per cent maximum. 
The civic body will receive subsidies to the tune of 25 per cent from the state government."" A team from World Bank had evinced interest in teaming up with SMC in undertaking a number of environmental friendly projects. The civic body will be undertaking construction of roads, bridges, traffic islands, gardens, sewage and solid waste disposal projects in the next few years. Meanwhile, a separate proposal on measuring air quality in the city was also approved by the standing committee. A SMC team along with Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI) will measure air quality in different parts of the city. The study will find out causes for pollution and recommend measures to tackle it.12 AIR QUALITY MONITORING MACHINES TO BE INSTALLEDThe civic body plans to install another 15 air pollution monitoring machines in the city soon after Lok Sabha elections. Two machines are already functioning at Varachha and Limbayat areas. A SMC officer said, ""We are waiting for National Green Tribunal's (NGT) guidelines. It will stipulate air quality monitoring machines according to a city's size."" SMC officials had earlier planned to have at least two machines in all the eight municipal zones of the city. The cost of one air pollution monitoring machine is approximately Rs50 lakh. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"North Indians more prone to stroke owing to diet, says study",The Times of India (TOI),4/28/2019,CHANDIGARH,"CHANDIGARH: A study under Indo-US collaborative stroke project has revealed that people living in the northern part of India receive more severe strokes compared to the population in the southern part of the country. This vulnerability is mainly due to plaque in atherosclerosis - the larger artery - and factors like diet, vitamin D levels, genetic risks, seasonal variations, and air pollution. The study has been recently published in 'International journal of stroke'. The study was conducted in association with a US-based coordinating center at five academic centres in India, including All-India Institutes of Medical Sciences in New Delhi (182 candidates); Christian Medical College and Hospital in Ludhiana (574 candidates); PGI in Chandigarh (306 candidates); Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad (443 candidates) and Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram (561 candidates). A total of 2,066 stroke patients (1,060 from north India and 1,006 from the south) were diagnosed. 
""In the study, we examined different risk factors in people belonging to northern and southern parts of India. This has enabled treatment and prevention according to the risk factors,"" said Professor Dheeraj Khurana, a neurologist at the PGI, who conducted this study.The study also revealed that most the patients in the north, who had acute stroke, reached hospital either by their own vehicle or a private transportation. Among the patients, who received intravenous thrombolysis IVT and/or intra-arterial treatment, 60.2% patients had used a private transportation and 30.6% patients were transferred from other hospitals.In the South, 62.2% patients were transferred from other hospitals and 25% arrived using a private transportation. The centers in the south have better coordination with local hospitals when it comes to transporting patients to comprehensive stroke centres, the study revealed.""Due to high patient load and fewer in-patient bed availability, many minor strokes and non-acute stroke patients do not get admission in centres in the north,"" said Prof Khurana.

UT demands progress report on CTU projects,The Times of India (TOI),04-01-2019,CHANDIGARH,"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has sought progress report on Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) projects, including purchase of electric buses.A senior UT official said after getting the progress report from CTU, the administration will accordingly send the final report to Centre.Recently, the Centre denied to release funds for UT's project of electric buses and thereafter the administration had decided to purchase the buses on its own. The UT administration has now also floated tenders in this regard. Earlier, the administration had written a letter to the Union ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises for the funding of the project, but the ministry denied to release the budget.According to information, the UT had planned to buy 20 electric buses for local routes to fight air pollution. 
There was budgetary estimate of Rs 32 crore for the project.The cost of each electric bus is between Rs 1.25 crore to Rs 1.40 crore, which were planned to be bought under a central government scheme, in which 60% of the cost will be borne by the Union ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had approved the project in November 2016 and thereafter the CTU had started the process of introducing electric buses in the city under the Smart City plan. The CTU had planned to induct electric buses in its fleet with an aim to cut down on pollution level. Over the years, the quality of air in the city has deteriorated beyond permissible level. Data compiled by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) points out that the level of repairable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) has been recorded above the permissible limits, that is, 100 microgram per cubic metre (mcg/cu m).In August 2017, the UT administration had even trialled buses from various companies. During the trial, weight of around 1,750kg was put in the buses. An 11-member team was constituted for inspection and compiling a report. Based on the report of the team, the authorities took the decision to purchase battery-operated buses.According to officials, the battery-operated buses have a life of 10 years and cover over 250km in one charge. It takes around six hours to charge the bus. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"1,686 mango farmers seek compensation for poor yield",The Times of India (TOI),5/16/2019,SURAT,"Surat: The luscious Valsadi Hafoos (alphonso) has fallen prey to severe industrial pollution in the mango belt of south Gujarat, which is also the hub of chemical industries.For the first time in so many years, farmers of Valsad district have demanded compensation from the government for the failure of mango crop. In a memorandum submitted to the district collector recently, 1,686 farmers stated that besides inclement weather conditions, the biggest contributor to the crop failure was air pollution. As a result of the foul air, the mango flowers have turned black, they said.Farmers in the mango stretch from from Chikhli in Navsari to Vapi in Valsad district have also asked the government to carry out detailed investigation to find out the causes of production losses, which they claimed was anything between 50-80%.They also requested Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to install air pollution monitoring system in each village.""Flowers in top half portion of the tree turned black while in the remaining half, flowering was normal. 
In such cases the production falls to half. The situation has only aggravated in the last three years, and the production has fallen to three tonnes only from 22 tonnes in my orchard of 3,000 mango trees,"" said Vinod Patel, sarpanch of Gorgam village in Valsad.N U Patel, deputy director, horticulture, Valsad, ""A number of farmers have suffered heavy mango crop loss and the yield has gone down drastically. Air pollution caused by the industries in the vicinity of these farms cannot be ruled out as the reason for this crop failure.""Valsadi Hafoos grown in south Gujarat are exported as well and this mango variety is known for its distinctive sweet taste. ""Out of the 4,000 mango tree in my orchard, I have uprooted 400 and replaced these with sugarcane. This year too, I pruned 100 trees due to crop failure. The production has dropped 80 percent in last three years and we are not even able to meet the production cost of pesticide, fertiliser and other expenses,"" said Kantilal Patel, a farmer from Tighra. ""There is no other reason but pollution and we are suffering heavy loss of production,"" he said.The farmers are demanding Rs 18,000 compensation per hectare to recover the cost of pesticide and fertilisers. Patel said, ""Excessive use of pesticide can also lead to production loss, but this is yet to be investigated."" Major chemical industries are concentrated in Vapi, Umargam and Sarigam Industrial pollution has remained major cause of concern for locals in this belt where punitive actions have also been taken by the government against the polluters. In some cases locals have resorted to protest while fighting against pollution.""The mango production is dropping due to sudden fluctuation in temperature in the last two years. The fluctuation is result of global warming and climate change for which pollution is one of the causes. However, there is no specific study of effect of pollution on mango cultivation,"" said B M Patel, principal, Aspee College of Horticulture, Navsari Agriculture University (NAU).

Their answer to bad air: Shift ministries out of city,The Times of India (TOI),05-10-2019,DELHI,"New Delhi: Azad Bharatam, a new ""liberal"" political party, has called for shifting of Union government ministries, departments and constitutional authorities out of Delhi and relocating these to other states and Union Territories to reduce the capital's population by 30-35 lakh and bring air pollution and congestion within tolerable limits.Elaborating on the plea, the party's founder, Rakesh Agarwal, said a Delhiite died 10 years sooner due to air pollution, which also caused 30,000 deaths per annum - 20 times more than road fatalities.""Delhi is the most polluted capital city in the world. It is a global shame and air pollution should be declared a national emergency just like UK's Parliament did on May 1,"" he said.The party, however, feels that an exemption could be made for Parliament, Rashtrapati Bhavan, PMO, ministry of external affairs and the constitutional bench of Supreme Court. ""Can anything be more important than life itself?
The day is not far when every school-going child wears a mask attached to an oxygen tank.

City's air quality index hides real-time data: Experts,The Times of India (TOI),6/21/2019,CHENNAI,"Chennai: The state's air quality index released by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on Tuesday conceals more than it reveals, according to environmentalists who have termed flawed the way data was presented by calculating averages.Shweta Narayan, coordinator of Healthy Energy Initiative India, said toxins such as PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less 2.5 micrometres) had significant effects on health and readings that were derived by calculating averages could not be relied on. Ideally, PM 2.5 should be below 40. ""We need to have more data sets. Only 24-hour monitoring of air will be able to provide data to draw any conclusion about pollution levels in the city,"" she said.The data did not reveal any information about the number of days the monitoring was done. 
It `was based on an average, which was a flawed approach, she said.Similarly, the number of samples and the average they had taken were also not clear. The PCB authorities had done an average of averages and claimed only a few hotspots in the state were polluted.Surprisingly, in North Chennai, there was no data from the Ennore region, which had a thermal power station. This station emits fly ash, which is collected in a pond in the Ennore creek. ""This fly ash is a major contributor of pollution in the city,"" she said.Finding a place in the NCAP will force the cities to come up with reduction and mitigation measures on air pollution. Currently, there is no such provisions to reduce pollution in Chennai, Madurai and Trichy, she pointed out.Former environment engineer D Velazhagan said PM 10 levels were increasing in many residential areas, including Adyar. Compared to last year, PM 10 levels had considerably gone up. All areas in the city have exceeded their limits in PM 2.5 value, he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Health experts urge Patnaites to take precautions not just outside, but in their houses as well to avoid air-borne health problems.""Air pollution can be ambient or household. 
While the former occurs due to emission of smoke from vehicles and industries, the latter can be caused due to the use of air fresheners and house paints. Ambient air pollution is responsible for bronchitis, emphysema and lung cancer, whereas household pollution can cause cough, asthma and skin irritation,"" said city-based pulmonologist Dr Sanjay Kumar.Physician Dr Pratyush Kumar claimed that the average life expectancy would increase by 1.7 years if the air quality improved. ""People with tuberculosis should stay away from industrial areas as continuous exposure to unhealthy air can aggravate their disease,"" he said.Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences' (IGIMS) skin department associate professor Dr Kranti advised people to wear masks while going outside and eat protein-rich food.

Women too vulnerable to lung cancer: Docs,The Times of India (TOI),6/15/2019,MADURAI,"Madurai: The notion that lung cancer occurs predominantly among men does not hold true as a notable percentage of women too suffer from the disease, say doctors here. However, they also add that the survival rate of people with lung cancer is significantly high if treated at a very early stage.The doctors were speaking at Vadamalayan Hospitals where three procedures were performed on as many patients - two of whom were women - with lung cancer in the last one month alone. Consultant surgical oncologist at the hospital Dr S Alagu Ganesh said there was a general conception that only smoking could increase the risk of lung cancer, which was not the case. 
""Since only smoking is perceived by the general public to be the only reason for lung cancer, they think only men are at higher risk,"" he said. Dr Ganesh added that though the exact cause for lung cancer among women could not be determined in many cases, the possible reasons could be air pollution caused by firewood stove, industrial pollution, genetic mutation and even hereditary. The doctors also said that at Vadamayalan Hospitals, about 30% to 40% of patients with lung cancer constituted women.The experts said that while the overall five-year survival rate was about 18%, if detected and treated early, it could go up by 60% to 70%. ""When an elderly person repeatedly coughs, it is often considered to be only due to old age. But if it's recurring, then they should be checked sooner,"" chief cardiothoracic surgeon Dr P Babu said. The three who underwent lung resections at the hospital last month included a 34-year-old woman with carcinoma in the left lung, 70-year-old man with right lower lobectomy and a 74-year-old woman with left lower lobectomy. The doctors said the surgeries were successful and they were able to send the patients home. The doctors also said that every year 1.61 million new cases of lung cancer were reported out of which 1.38million died, making lung cancer the leading cause of cancer-related mortality.

There are many species of trees that absorb dust that help minimise the impact of air pollution.According to reports, over one crore saplings will be planted in the district this year, in the monsoon. Divisional forest officer (DFO), C Selvan said, ""The saplings are being raised in various nurseries and would be planted across the district during the monsoon. Our target is to plant one crore saplings. We will also distribute saplings to farmers, especially cashew, casuarina and eucalyptus saplings. Various public sector units, corporations, educational and health institutions have been roped in for the drive.""The DFO further said there are various kinds of trees such as pongamia, neem, ficus, jamun and badam that help reduce pollution by absorbing dust. These trees provide shade and enhance green cover, helping release more oxygen into the atmosphere.

Pollution fears rise over proposed Bainguinim plant,The Times of India (TOI),7/22/2019,GOA,"Panaji: Residents of Bainguinim and Old Goa on Saturday demanded that the state government shift the proposed 250-tonne garbage treatment plant away from Bainguinim. They claimed that if the plant was set up there, leachate would contaminate the groundwater and surrounding fields.Citizens, under the banner of Pornem Goemcho Nagrik Monch, claimed that once the plant was operational, air and water pollution would affect the 4,000-odd people living in the area. All the housing projects along the nearby Kadamba plateau rely on borewells for their domestic water supply, which is the main reason why the residents have vowed to oppose the facility.""We will have to approach NGT and courts to stop the garbage plant from being set up there,"" the organisation's president, Ambar Amonkar, told reporters.NIO scientist Dr Anil Kumar Saran, who was also present, said there were ""certain gaps in the study"" conducted as part of the environment impact assessment (EIA). ""I am not saying the waste treatment plant should not come up, but a lot more research should be done,"" he said. 
Former head of Goa University's microbiology department, Joe D'Souza, also said that a proper ground study needed to be done before the government went ahead with the project.Saran suggested instead of a rapid EIA, the Goa Waste Management Corporation should conduct a year-long study to identify the flora and fauna around the heritage site. ""The garbage plant is based on a bio-methanation process, which means methane will be released. Methane is bad for the environment, especially for lakes and ponds,"" he said.Land for the proposed Bainguinim garbage treatment plant was identified in 2008 as part of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, while residential complexes came up around the area from 2011 onwards. The residents, however, refused to blame the builders for constructing the complexes within 500 metres of the proposed garbage facility. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Drop in air quality could stoke breathing issues: Doctors,The Times of India (TOI),07-04-2019,GOA,"Edited. 270 words. To go with 'Let Our City Breathe' logo.Times News NetworkPanaji: Falling air quality levels in some parts of the state could make people living in those areas vulnerable to respiratory diseases. 
Doctors say people with pre-existing breathing conditions, such as asthma, are particularly susceptible.In its report for 2018-19 the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has singled out the state capital and three major towns Mapusa, Vasco and Mormugao (MPT) for dwindling air quality. It has found respirable particulate matter (PM) to be beyond the permissible limit in all four areas that together accommodate a population of over three lakh.""If a person is already suffering from a respiratory problem like bronchitis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, air pollution could aggravate it. Poor air quality could also cause an allergy-like breathing condition,"" city-based doctor Rufino Monteiro, says. The annual limit for levels of PM10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) is 60 microgram/m3. Mormugao (MPT), however, registered a PM10 count of 117 microgram/m3 between April 2018 and March 2019. Vasco recorded the second-highest level of 87, followed by Panaji with 83 and Mapusa with 67. A source appropriation study is under way in Vasco in view of coal pollution there. It is aimed at quantifying the contribution of emissions from various sources that contribute to air pollution.Prepared as part of the National Air Monitoring Programme, the GSPCB's report for 2018-19 has also found PM2.5 to be moderately high in Panaji, Vasco and Mormugao (MPT). It attributes the cause to vehicular movement, construction activities and industrial emission. ""Data indicates that levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are within permissible limits,"" it adds. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Eco concerns over plan to link Balbharati, Paud Road",The Times of India (TOI),8/26/2019,PUNE,"Pune: The proposed link road between Balbharati on Senapati Bapat Road and Paud Phata have drawn environmental concerns at a stakeholders' meeting on Saturday.Citizens and activists said the project should not impact the area's biodiversity, even as a solution was needed to decongest the choked Law College Road. The road was proposed to free up Law College Road by providing an alternative to motorists travelling from Kothrud to Senapati Bapat Road and beyond. The project was challenged in the Bombay high court, which directed a detailed environmental and traffic impact study. 
Saturday's meeting, held by PMC-appointed consulting firm VK:e environmental, was a bid to get feedback from the stakeholders.The study deals with existing environment quality, land use, hydrogeology, air, water and soil quality, along the proposed alignment of the road.As per the plan, 800m of forest land, 200m of reserved park, 500m of residential/slum areas and 600m of public-semi public zones will be used for the road.""We have taken up an extensive study to identify both the positive and negative environmental and social effects of the project. We will develop an action plan to enhance the positives and mitigate the negatives to ensure long-term sustainability,"" Anagha Paranjape-Purohit of VK:e environmental said.Paranjape-Purohit said citizens' suggestions will be included in the final draft, which will be submitted to the civic administration.Citizens, however, were not entirely convinced about the project. ""It will be just a short-term solution for a tiny section of the city. The entire city suffers from traffic congestion and pollution and needs a holistic solution,"" Sushma Date, a local resident, said. ""It is ironic that a road that will destroy an urban forest is proposed as a solution to high pollution levels,"" Date said, adding, ""Instead of more roads, the PMC should improve public transport.""Elected representatives backed the project. ""The road will help resolve traffic issues in the area. Residents and pedestrians suffer from daily traffic jams and there has been a significant increase in air pollution in the Law College Road and Karve Road areas,"" corporator Madhuri Sahastrabuddhe said. Manjushree Khardekar, another corporator, said steps can be taken to mitigate the environmental impact. Do you use the Law College Road for your daily commute?

Demolition: IIT-Madras warns of serious environmental impact,The Times of India (TOI),9/19/2019,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,"Thiruvananthapuram: Demolition of apartment complexes at Maradu would generate waste at a rate of 450kg/sq m and for a building with a built-up area of 1,00,000 sq ft, the demolition waste generated would be about 4500 tonnes. It would trigger pollution impact of various kinds within a radius of 1km, said an environment impact assessment (EIA) study by IIT-Madras.It would require 0.25 acres to pile up the debris resulting from demolition of building (1,00,000 sq ft in area) and the debris would take up a layer measuring (approx) 3m high. The team cited implosion by explosives as the most-appropriate method but added that it would be impossible to remove the foundations, especially the 35m deep cast-in-situ bored reinforced concrete piles expected under the buildings.The final study report, which was submitted to state government late on Tuesday, warned of significant environmental impact like air and noise pollution that could cover a radius of 1km and vibrations that could damage nearby buildings and disturb their occupants. 
It said that proper restoration is a must if demolition is carried out and it must be done based on the 'polluter pays' principle.The study was done by an eight-member team led by Dr Ravindra Gettu, dean, Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research, IIT-Madras. Site inspections were done by the team on July 3, 2019 and on July 27, 2019. The team held discussions with KCZMA, KSCSTE and Maradu municipality officials before preparing the report.""Though air pollution is short-lived, resuspension of particulate matter at a later time, due to favourable atmospheric conditions, is a cause for concern. People living in nearby apartments, waterways and vulnerable plants would be at grave risk due to air pollution. The noise generated will be very high (of the order 130dB in case of implosion method). The noise will be heard a kilometre away. Even at a distance of 250m, the noise level will be 80dB, which is more than the permissible limit,"" the report said.The report also took note of carbon footprint and said that demolition of highrises before the end of their service lives (such as the ones in Maradu) would lead to a significant negative impact, arising from loss or waste of carbon footprint and embodied energy.""If you consider an apartment with 1,500 sq ft carpet area in a reinforced concrete building, the wasted carbon footprint is at least 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide. It could then be estimated that the demolition of a complex with 80 such apartments, with a remaining life of 50 years, would have the same negative impact as the removal of 1 sq km of mangroves, over the same period of time,"" it said.The team also studied the present environmental impact of apartment complexes. During inspections, it was observed that sewage from several complexes is discharged into the nearby backwaters directly without treatment or after only partial treatment, which could lead to severe pollution.

Transport Corporation to roll out eco-friendly buses,The Times of India (TOI),09-06-2019,PATNA,"PATNA: The Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) is set to roll out eco-friendly buses in the city. It will soon procure four electric buses and convert the diesel engines of 20 existing buses to compressed natural gas (CNG).According to a BSRTC official, the bidding process for purchasing the electric buses and converting diesel engines to CNG has been initiated. ""Depending on how the trial goes, we may install CNG kits in more buses,"" the official told TOI.The BSRTC runs at least 110 diesel-based buses in Patna under the city bus service.The supply of CNG in the state capital began after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Patna City Gas Distribution Network at Begusarai on February 17 this year. 
At present, the gas is being supplied to two petrol pumps at Rukanpura and Bypass road.The BSRTC official said, ""We are planning to run the electric buses on Bailey Road as it is wide. Such buses can cover a distance up to 150km after being recharged.""Transport department officials claimed that efforts to run eco-friendly electric buses were being made in order to curb air pollution. As per recent surveys, Patna is among the most polluted cities in the world and vehicular emission is one of the reasons behind it.The Bihar State Pollution Control Board had released an action plan for controlling air pollution in Patna on May 10 last year. It envisaged use of cleaner fuels like CNG in the state capital.Environmental experts hailed the move of the transport department to introduce CNG and electric buses. ""Vehicular emission leads to air pollution and the scenario worsens in the peak winter months of December and January. Hence, introducing eco-friendly vehicles is a welcome step,"" Central University of South Bihar's environmental science department professor Pradhan Parth Sarthi said.

"Bengaluru: Despite demand, CBD lacks CNG filling station",The Times of India (TOI),9/20/2019,BENGALURU,"BENGALURU: With the entry of Compressed Natural Gas-run quadricycles, drivers are slowly switching to environment-friendly vehicles. But there's a hitch: lack of CNG-filling stations in the heart of the city.Bengaluru is home to 1,257 CNG vehicles and more are expected to hit the roads in the coming days. But the dearth of filling stations in central business district (CBD) is hampering transition to the cleaner fuel.GAIL Gas, a CNG provider, is finding it difficult to procure land for a filling station in CBD. 
At present, Bengaluru has 15 CNG filling stations, of which a majority are on the outskirts. Of the 1,257 CNG vehicles, including cars, taxis, buses, trucks and autorickshaws plying in Bengaluru, 715 are registered in Karnataka.App-based aggregator Uber along with Bajaj Auto recently launched Quadricycle under the UberXS platform. The four-wheeler which is smaller and lighter than a passenger car can accommodate driver plus three others and has become a hit.Srikanth S, who runs a quadricycle says: ""It's more economical than an LPG auto but finding a filling station is very difficult. We need stations in the city's core areas."" Several LPG auto drivers are also shifting to CNG vehicles.Sources in GAIL Gas said shortage of land in CBD is delaying stations. ""We are in talks with major oil marketing firms, including IOCL, to set up CNG stations at their retail outlets,"" said a source.The existing retail price of CNG is approximately Rs 58.6 per kg. A CNG auto can save about Rs 5,500 per month compared to the LPG version while a CNG taxi can save about Rs 8,000 compared to the diesel model. A CNG car can reduce fuel bill by 40% as opposed to a petrol car, said a GAIL Gas spokesperson.""Vehicle emissions are the biggest contributor to air pollution in Bengaluru. CNG is not only environment-friendly but also economical. We have commissioned 23 CNG stations, of which15 are operational. We are planning to set up 100 CNG stations at a cost of Rs 300 crore in next 2-3 years in Bengaluru,"" said the spokesperson.The city got its first CNG station in October 2016. With commissioning of more stations, it's expected to join the league of cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Indore and Agra. Vehicles can be retrofitted with CNG at four authorised centres (see box). Conversion cost for four-wheelers is around Rs 28,000, two-wheelers Rs 24,000 and autorickshaws Rs 25,000.GAIL gas CNG stationsBeggar's Colony in Prem Nagar, APC Circle in Jigani, near Aero Space Park near Huvinayakanahalli, Srigandadakaval near Magadi Main Road, Bommasandra Industrial Area, Tatanagar near Kodigehalli, Dasanapura near Magadi Road, Peenya Industrial Area, Agara on Sarjapur Road, Doddakannelli (Sarjapur Road), Haldenahali village in Anekal taluk, Sanjeevanagar on Bannerghatta Road, Honnenahalli village near Rajankunte, Virupakshapura near Vidyaranyapura and Hunasamaranahalli village near Jalahobli.Retro fitment centresKanakanagar near RT Nagar, Munishwara Block near Laggere, RMV 2nd Stage, Inner Ring Road near Koramangala.

"In a week, city's air quality worsens by 100%",The Times of India (TOI),10-10-2019,CHANDIGARH,"Chandigarh: The air you are breathing has deteriorated drastically over the last week in the city. From an average air quality index (AQI) of 55 on October 1, the AQI has plunged to 101 on Tuesday - an increase of around 100% - on a day when effigies of Ravana, Meghnad and Kumbhkarna were burnt at 40 locations. However, the air quality remained 'satisfactory' to 'moderate' during the evening hours between 4 pm and 8 pm on Dussehra - a fact that could be misleading. Experts explained the data does not indicate the air quality on Dusshera as the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has installed only one Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Panjab University, Sector 25, which gives real time monitoring data. 
The real picture would be clear on Wednesday, when the CPCC would collect data from five different locations.A scientist with the CPCC said Sector 25 machine collects data from in and around Sector 25 and Panjab University. Moreover, wind direction also plays a major role in capturing the data, he said.Recently, the UT administration decided to conduct a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution. At present, the UT does not have any data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of pollution.Last year, the administration rejected the proposal because of its high cost. In 2017, the environment department representatives held a meeting with officials of Union environment ministry in which it was discussed that IIT, Kanpur, had procured Switzerland-made monitoring devices worth Rs 5 crore each to conduct the study in four different cities. One such device was proposed to be installed in Chandigarh. Debendra Dalai, director, environment, and vice-chairman, CPCC, said as the cost was very high, the proposal was then turned down. Now, they would float a tender to carry out the study, he added.The administration had recently submitted its action plan to control air pollution in Chandigarh to the Union government. The UT had submitted that it has already launched extensive drive against polluting vehicles and prepared an action plan to widen roads and improvement of infrastructure for decongestion of roads.The other initiatives mentioned included synchronization of traffic signals in the city, greening of open areas, and introducing water fountain at major traffic intersections, wherever feasible, with the use of tertiary treated water, promoting battery operated vehicles, green buffers along traffic corridors, and introducing intelligent traffic management system.The UT submitted that the ambient air quality of the city is mainly affected by the increase in the number of vehicles. ""There has been an increase of around 60% in the number of vehicles in 10 years with no change in the length of roads. Increase of light motor vehicles (LMVs), basically cars, by more than 100% in the past 10 years in comparison to approximately 48% increase in two-wheelers. This has resulted in more congestion, ultimately contributing to air pollution,"" the UT had submitted.The officials maintained that dust, crop harvesting seasons, effects of pollens due to greenery, temperature effect, industrial surroundings and vehicular density are the main reasons behind high pollution.TRACKING AQITime | Oct 1 | Oct 84 pm 55 | 1025 pm 57 | 1016 pm 57 | 1007 pm 58 | 998 pm 59 | 989 pm ...| 57AQI: Air Quality Index Six categoriesThe air quality index (AQI) has six categories--good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severeAQI | Remarks |Health impacts0-50 Good | Minimal | Impact51-100 | Satisfactory | Minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people101-200 | Moderate | Breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases201-300 | Poor | Breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure301-400 Very poor | Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure401-500 | Severe | Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseasesKey pollution factorsDustStubble burningVehicular populationPetroleum productsIndustrial activitiesEffects of pollensMonitoring data from 5 locationsChandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) measures the level of pollution by installing air quality monitoring devices at five locations - Punjab Engineering College Sector 12; Imtech, Sector 39; Industrial Area; Kaimbwala village and Sector 17 - covering institutional area, industrial zone, rural area and commercial areas, respectively.

Stay healthy and go easy on sweets during festive season,The Times of India (TOI),10/22/2019,DIET,"The environment is so positive as the festive season has begun and the excitement sees no bounds.. navratri and now Diwali. Diwali in our country is celebrated even before it is supposed to be as outings, guests visit, dinner parties, etc.. happen which are inevitable. With this, most often we end up indulging in sweets and other sinful foods, and then of course the guilt which then forces us to try for some easy ways to get rid of those extra kilos. But, the worst part is we want to do all the wrong means to shed that extra fat which again leads to a YO-YO effect.I, therefore would love to share a few health tips with you which would help you stay away from this vicious cycle of: binging, feeling guilty, weight gain, wrong methods of losing weight, weight gain, feeling guilty again.Do try this-1. If you plan to go out, don't go on an empty stomach. 
Eat a small snack before you head out. Choose snacks like boiled corn, mix veggie salad, a fruit bowl, sprouts, veggie soup, yogurt with crushed nuts, whole wheat bread sandwich, etc. This will keep you full and thereby prevent binging/over eating when you are2. If one meal goes for a toss, make sure the rest of the meals are absolutely on track. E.g. If you have a dinner party planned, make sure your meals through the day (breakfast, lunch, snacking items) are very much balanced and healthier.3. Sip water frequently throughout the day. It will keep you hydrated and will also satiate the false hunger.4. Pick healthier desserts- Choose dry fruits/fruits/kheer/phirni/shrikhand (you can make it using hung curd)/dark chocolates/til or peanut chikkis/dink laddoos (gum arabic)/ sheera/ date rolls/ date-walnut mithai, etc. over any other sugar loaded sweets. Sweets made out of jaggery or organic honey are good to go. Remember, we need to take care of the portions too.5. Please choose baked food items over deep fried ones.6. Compensate- It's true that saying ""NO"" when you are offered sweets by your loved ones especially during this festive season is going to be difficult. Don't worry! Pick one, eat it mindfully and enjoy the eating experience. Now you know what to do next. Compensate for your extra caloric intake in your following meals. More fiber (salads, veggies), good amount of proteins and lesser carbs.7. Go easy on alcohol. It's a major dehydrator and contains empty calories. Choose red wine or vodka over any other hard drinks. Sangria would be the best option here (cut fruits in red wine).8. Be a health-conscious host this Diwali. Serve snacks like dhokla, masalapeanuts, unsalted nuts and dry fruits, sprout-chaat, fruit salad, idlis, baked chaklis Avoid serving soft drinks or artificial juices. Lemon water, jal jeera, flavoured milk, spiced buttermilk, fresh fruit juice would be some better options here.9. Fire crackers are going to pollute the air. The pollutants (free radicals) have an easy access into our body as we breathe. Neutralize the free radicals by consuming adequate antioxidants through colourful fruits, berries and vegetables.10. Last but not the least, don't forget to work out! Workouts would kick your body metabolism in high gear, helping you burn calories faster. It's best to get your workout done before going out for a party. The spiked metabolism would help you burn better when you eat at the party.Enjoy the festival, stay mindful throughout and have a great time!

Showers make Indore air cleaner by 70% this Diwali,The Times of India (TOI),10/31/2019,INDORE,"Indore: Air pollution level in city registered a record decline of over 70 per cent on Diwali night this year thanks to the incessant rains that started from early morning and continued till afternoon. However, noise pollution level increased by nearly three per cent. District pollution control board monitored the ambient air quality at six locations including DIG Office, Mhow Naka, pologround, Vijay Nagar (automatic station), Vijay Nagar (manual station) and Kothari Market. 
The average ambient air quality (PM10) level during Diwali declined by 214 points compared to PM10 level on Diwali day back in 2015, said officials. If compared with last year's Diwali, there is a decline of 185 marks. In 2018, PM10 value was recorded to be 258 during Diwali, a decrease of over 70 per cent. On normal days, it is recorded to be less than 100 per cubic metre. Officials said that incessant rain on day of Diwali was an important factor contributing to the decline in particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) levels. ""There was around 7mm rainfall recorded on Diwali. It started raining since early morning which continued till afternoon leading to a significant decline in PM10 level,"" said district pollution control board senior scientist Dilip Waghela. Difference of average PM2.5 level recorded a week before Diwali and on Sunday night as per the guidelines also declined by 19 points. ""The average value of PM2.5 which was recorded to be 70 on October 20, decreased to 51 during Diwali,"" he added. The average noise pollution level recorded on Diwali was 71.59 decibel.

"Ravan Dahan goes hi-tech with water-proof effigies, HD fireworks",The Times of India (TOI),10-09-2019,BHOPAL,"Bhopal: Dussehra is here. Soaked in the festive spirit, people are ready to witness Ravan effigies burn. And the ongoing rain can play no spoilsport this year. To ensure that the king of Lanka meets his fiery end and the spectacle remains grand, Ravan Dahan organising committees have taken the tech route this year: Water-proof Ravan effigies and digital fireworks. 
Welcome to Kolar Dussehra maidan. At 105 feet, the Ravan here is not just the tallest in Madhya Pradesh but the effigy is high-tech as well. ""The tallest Ravan effigy will meet his end amid traditional as well as digital fireworks. The digital fireworks will be projected on a large high-definition (HD) screen. The aim is not just to put a check on air pollution but also ensure that the rain does not spoil the festive mood,"" said president of Kolar Hindu Utsav Samiti, Ravindra Yati. The organisers say that have spent more than Rs 20 lakh on the event. ""We spared no expenses,"" said Yati.The Kolar Ravan is set to get a tough fight from the Bittan Market Ravan in terms of the event grandeur. The effigy at Dussehra ground here will be a good 57 feet tall. ""Every year we reduce the height of the effigy by a foot to symbolize that 'evil' in the society is reducing. This year the Ravan is 57 feet tall,"" said Sanjay Vyas of Bittan Market Dussehra Samiti.The effigies at BHEL Dussehra ground too are water-proof. ""Though it rained for an hour today, nothing happened to the effigies kept out there in the open. The Ravan effigy is 50 feet tall while Meghnad and Kumbhakaran are 45 and 40 feet tall respectively,"" said AGM BHEL Tapan Suhane. The effigies were given a coat of polythene to prevent damage from rain. The organizers said they have made all arrangements for safety. ""A fire-brigade tanker and an ambulance will be stationed at the venue. We have also made an iron frame to fire rockets in a straight line,"" said Suhane.This year the size of the oldest Dussehra celebrations has been reduced due to the change in venue. The T T Nagar Dussehra ground is under construction. As the burning of the effigies will take place near Kasturba School, the organisers have reduced the height of the effigies. ""The height of the Ravan effigy has been reduced by 10 feet to ensure safety,"" said Om Prakesh Khurana, joint secretary of the T T Nagar Dussehra Utsav Samiti.Effigies have also been installed at Chhola maidan and other grounds and localities of the city.

School kids pledge to shun firecrackers,The Times of India (TOI),10/24/2019,PATNA,"PATNA: Many schoolchildren in the city have pledged not to burn crackers this Diwali in a bid to prevent air pollution. An intensive campaign in this regard has been launched by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), under which the school kids are being made aware of ill effects of harmful gases emitted from burning crackers.The school kids are taking pledge of not burning crackers during morning prayer sessions. Incidentally, the air quality in Patna worsens in the peak winter months between November and January.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said involvement of people, especially children, are of paramount importance in raising awareness on environment conservation. ""Government policies cannot work unless people are aware of their own safety and welfare,"" Ghosh added.BSPCB conducted an oath-taking ceremony in Krishna Niketan School on Tuesday. Addressing an assembly of 3,200 students, they encouraged them not to use firecrackers during Diwali.

"How many vehicles can city take, NGT asks Centre again",The Times of India (TOI),10-02-2019,DELHI,"New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has rapped the Union road transport ministry over its failure to submit a report on the number of vehicles permitted to ply on Delhi roads in proportion to their capacity.Terming it as a ""criminal offence"", a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel granted the last opportunity to the secretary of the ministry to furnish the report in a month. ""It is unclear why the report is still pending despite the tribunal's order, violation of which is a criminal offence and may require coercive action,"" the bench added.The tribunal noted that it had ordered the ministry to conduct the study in October last year, which was scheduled to be heard on April 29, 2019. However, without the report, the case was adjourned thrice, it noted. ""The applicant must furnish a complete set of papers to the secretary and file an affidavit of service within a week,"" NGT said, while posting the matter to December 9.Noting the adverse impact of vehicular emissions on the air quality, the tribunal had directed the transport ministry to conduct a study on the number of vehicles that could be permitted in Delhi in proportion to the capacity of the roads.The green court had said the menace of illegal parking and encroachment was a serious issue not only in Delhi, but in all the major cities. 
The tribunal's directions had come while hearing a plea filed by a bus operator, Metro Transit Private Ltd, seeking direction to remove the hawkers, construction material lying on the roads and stop unauthorised parking. According to the applicant, it was difficult to conduct operations as substantial parts of the roads were occupied either by the hawkers or the vehicles, which lead to congestion, adding to the air pollution.

Farmers get lessons on harmful effects of stubble burning,The Times of India (TOI),11/24/2019,BAREILLY,"Bareilly: With air quality deteriorating from poor to severe in many parts of northern India, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) here has taken up the task of training farmers on how to deal with stubble after harvesting. They are being primed about how stubble burning not only pollutes the air but also harms them -- causing loss of soil nutrients.Raj Karan Singh, senior scientist and head of KVK, told TOI, ""Stubble has nutrient contents -- 10 quintals of stubble contains 5.50 kg of nitrogen, 2.30 kg phosphorous, 1.20 kg sulphur, 20-25 kg potassium and 400 kg of organic matter. If stubble is not burnt but is decomposed in farms, there is a 20% increase in yield. 
Decomposed stubble makes grain filling better. There is an increment in tillers and grains per ear head.""On the other hand, stubble burning impacts environment causing pollution, he added.According to officials, the training programme of farmers from villages of Bareilly will continue till the first week of December. During the training, KVK teams will also be demonstrating the use of equipment for safe disposal of stubble. Among the equipment are happy seeder, shrub master, RMB plough and zero till drill. Besides, KVK teams are involving students to create awareness among farmers.Singh said, ""Farmers earlier used to manually harvest crop (paddy) leaving behind three- to-four-inch-long stubble. However, for the past few years, most of the farmers using machines for harvesting, leaving behind 20- to-22-inch-long stubble. A few farmers burn stubble as it is a convenient method for them. However, we are suggesting alternative methods."" Mahesh Chander, joint director, extension education, IVRI, said, ""We should suggest more ways to farmers on alternate use of stubble so that they are not forced to burn it.""

How pollution is disrupting lives in Gurgaon,The Times of India (TOI),11/16/2019,GURGAON,"Gurgaon: Our lifespans are shrinking every year, and there's evidence to back up that claim.In a recent study on the air quality life index by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, it was shown that Indians living in the plains face having seven years lopped off their life expectancy. In Gurgaon, often ranked the most polluted city in the nation, that statistic assumes more menacing proportions.For many in Gurgaon, life has been disrupted by a smog that lingers like an overlong nightmare. It's a state of affairs for which the authorities, twiddling their thumbs while citizens daily breathe in a cocktail of toxins, are wholly culpable. ""Crores of people are affected by this and still everyone is silent - are we waiting for the Great NCR Smog?""
asked Raveesh Shrivastava, who recently became a father.Poignantly, Raveesh can't set eyes on his little one because of the thick haze that hangs ominously, and seemingly perpetually, over his hometown, leaving him and everyone else deprived of the sun's life-giving warmth. ""Unfortunately, I never thought I will have to leave him because of this pollution; both my wife and baby are vulnerable. When I am myself waking up sneezing and coughing, how can I get the mother and child back?""For a week, Aadish Pal, who lives in Sector 50, has been suffering from an eye infection. ""I was told by the doctor that itching of eyes is a common symptom which people in the city have been complaining about. My wife is also suffering from cold because of infection from the air we inhale,"" he told TOI.Pooja Aggarwal, a Faridabad resident who commutes to Gurgaon for work, likened the 10-minute wait for her shuttle outside office to being trapped in a gas chamber. ""Normally, the smog clears and pollution levels come down a week after Diwali. But, this time it's persisting as if to haunt us, and remind us how we have created this Frankenstein's monster,"" she said, describing a scene straight out of a 19th-century Gothic novel.""As such, breathing is difficult... the situation is really scary these days,"" continued Aggarwal, echoing the fears of many in the Millennium City. And if you're a pedestrian, it's an even harder life. For, you risk being exposed to traffic fumes and the suffocating smog. ""I don't know what to complain about - the inability to breathe or (inability) to see roads while crossing them,"" remarked Rupesh Singh, a Delhi resident who works in an IT firm in Gurgaon.So dire is the situation that many, especially the elderly, feel it would be better if they left Gurgaon for good, only because they have been denied their basic right of clean air. ""This is the fourth consecutive year that we are witnessing polluted air, and, at the age of 70, it is difficult to process air which is not suitable to breathe. I am unable to take morning and evening walks,"" lamented Praveen Agarwal, a resident of Sector 46.This city, he adds despondently, is no longer liveable. ""We have been advised by doctors not to step out of our homes as the bad air will complicate our health issues.""Predictably, city hospitals have been logging more visits from people complaining of breathing problems. According to Dr Piyush Goel, senior pulmonologist at Columbia Asia, there has been a 30% increase in respiratory cases, with new cases coming in every day. ""There has also been an increase in health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (or, COPD),"" he revealed.Dr Arunesh Kumar - senior pulmonologist, and head of department, Chest Institute and Respiratory Medicine, Paras Hospital, Gurgaon - pointed to a rise of 30% in respiratory disorders in the past week, and an increase of 20% in new cases in the last couple of days alone. ""The air now contains highly toxic heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, manganese, sodium, potassium, etc. Such presence of metals in the air can trigger an asthma attack in a patient, causing severe headaches and respiratory problems,"" he explained.More troublingly, Dr Goel reveals, overexposure to pollution can result in lung cancer. And even the foetus in a mother's womb, he adds, is not safe from air heavy with pollutants. This is, by any standards, a health emergency, but you wouldn't know it from the response (or lack thereof) from those in power, a response that's as invisible as the particulate matter that penetrates our noses, eyes and mouths.Kids, too, can't escape the effects of bad air. ""I don't go out at all and staying indoors is not fun,"" rues Brinda Aggarwal, a Class IX student. She's not unlike other Gurgaon schoolchildren, silently cursing the pollution for keeping them inside. Meanwhile, Brinda's brother Rohan is more concerned about his studies than his health.Whether working professionals or schoolgoing children, housewives or senior citizens, the majority of Gurugrammers is struggling to make it through each day without fretting over their physical wellbeing. ""We are worried about our health as we do not see any improvement in the condition, for the air quality is still in severe category,"" bemoans Pal. But, unlike the Londoners of 1952, they can't see a way out of this gloom. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Goel flouts rule in protest, AAP says unfortunate",The Times of India (TOI),11-05-2019,DELHI,"New Delhi: On Day 1, the road-rationing scheme allowed only even-numbered private cars on Delhi's roads. However, Delhi BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel travelled in his odd-numbered car to protest against the ""gimmick"". ""This scheme is just a gimmick. The AAP government itself says the pollution is due to stubble burning, then how does the scheme help?""
Goel asked while starting from Chandni Chowk. He later stopped at the roundabout near Le Meridian Hotel in central Delhi and volunteered to get penalised.Calling Goel's move ""unfortunate"", AAP said BJP leaders were sending a message to people to not follow Delhi government's efforts to curb air pollution. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot also met Goel at his residence with a bouquet of flowers to request him ""to co-operate with the people of Delhi in the coming days"".The last digit of Goel's SUV was 7 and he had got anti-government and anti-scheme slogans pasted all over it. A former Delhi BJP chief, Goel was accompanied by the party's Delhi in-charge, Shyam Jaju, West Delhi MP Parvesh Saheb Singh Verma and others. Goel was the most vocal BJP leader against the scheme during its first and second editions too. ""I am doing this as a symbolic protest against the Kejriwal government's failure to do anything in five years to curb pollution in Delhi. It is now staging a drama and an election stunt in view of the coming assembly polls,"" Goel said. Speaking to Gahlot in front of the media, Goel said if the AAP government was serious, it should have called a meeting of all seven Delhi MPs. He also questioned its timing. All Delhi MPs are from BJP. Gahlot said, If 50% cars do not ply, at least some amount of pollution will reduce."" The government found an unlikely supporter in Delhi Congress' Ajay Maken. ""Vijay Goel MP-A LawMaker! Is deliberately driving an odd-number car on an even-numbered day! I've been (the) most vocal critic of Kejriwal - But I will never contribute to air pollution as a way of protest!"" Maken tweeted. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Haryana to cancel firearm licences of farmers who burnt crop residue,The Times of India (TOI),11/21/2019,GURGAON,"CHANDIGARH: In a deterrent measure to stop farmers in Haryana from burning stubble, which has become one of the reasons for massive air pollution, the state government has initiated the process to cancel their arms' licences.A large number of notices have been issued by the deputy commissioners of paddy sowing belts in the state to the farmers who were found to be involved in burning crop residue. Maximum of such notices have been issued in Sirsa and Fatehabad, districts with high number of arms' licences. The notices have been issued by the DCs, who also act as district magistrates, on receiving recommendations from the superintendents of police (SPs) of the area.The notices are issued to farmers, who are booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC for burning stubble despite ban by the administration. 
On verification, if the police finds if the farmer who burnt stubble has been issued arms' licence, a recommendation is made by the SP concerned to the DC for cancellation of that licence with the remarks that keeping of arms licence by such person is ""not in public interest"".On receiving SP's recommendations, the DC issues a notice under Section 17 (3) of the Arms Act, 1959, beginning the process for cancellation of the licence of farmer concerned. According to the data received from the state agriculture department, nearly 1,500 FIRs have been registered till date in Haryana for burning stubble.Talking to TOI, one of the DCs said the move will be of great help for the administration to pressurise farmers indulging in stubble burning. Getting an arms' licence is not only a difficult task, but is also considered a matter of prestige in the local society. ""This would certainly act as deterrent, as people do not want to lose their arms' licences that they had procured for self-defence. Legally also, once FIR is registered against them for defiance of government order, a ground is made for cancellation of licence,"" DC had informed.When contacted, Keshni Anand Arora, chief secretary Haryana, said the decision to cancel licences have been taken by the DCs at their level to control the situation of stubble burning in the state.Several other serious efforts are also being made by the authorities to stop stubble burning. ""It was perhaps because of the stringent steps taken by the authorities, Haryana is able to control the incidents of fires due to stubble burning, when compared with Punjab. Clear directions have been issued, empowering DCs to take all possible steps to curb this menace,"" Arora said.According to S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), till date, nearly 6,296 cases of stubble fire have been reported in the state this season when compare with previous year's 8,750 cases. He also confirmed that number of incidents of fire in Punjab is higher. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Is air pollution also making us depressed? Studies agree,The Times of India (TOI),11-05-2019,DE-STRESS,"Unless you have been living under the rock, you must be well aware of the thick envelope of toxic air that has engulfed Delhi-NCR. The residents are waking up to irritated eyes, sore throat and a sensation of choking. The air pollution levels have reached a disturbing three-year high, well into the ""severe"" range.The dangers of air pollution on human health From respiratory distress to heart, brain and even the health of the expectant mothers, these unusually high levels of particulates in the air are known to cause several acute and chronic medical conditions. 
However, in addition to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory symptoms, this dangerous cocktail of air pollutants can damage your mental health as well.The psychological impact of the choking airExposure to high levels of air pollution has been linked with affecting brain development in children and worsen the existing mental health conditions. Yes, the dreaded air pollution seems to damage much more than the visible physiological effects. According to a journal published in the Lippincott Portfolio by Wolters Kluwer, the mental health of the teenagers is more susceptible to the damage caused by airborne particles.The studyTo conduct the research, 144 teenagers were given a social stress test which included a five-minute speech and a math test. Shockingly, after studying the adolescents' heart rate and other bodily responses, it was found that teenagers with a higher autonomic response to stress, also had an increased level of PM 2.5 near their house. While the association between polluted air and greater stressors has not been explained in the study, it re-emphasises the fact that toxic air may also damage neurodevelopment and cognitive function.How air pollution is STRESSING us outIt does not matter which news channel you put on or newspaper you pick up to read, they are flooded with the impact of deadly levels of air pollution. Moreover, the doctors have strongly advised avoiding stepping outside unless absolutely needed. People have also been asked to stop working out outdoors and avoid strenuous exercises which may cause rapid breathing. Short winter days, grey skies and the presence of choking air everywhere are bound to stress anyone out and contribute to a persistent low mood.Can air pollution also plunge you into depressionA report published in the Ochsner Journal points to data from China published in 2018. According to that data, every 1 standard deviation rise in particulate matter over an average PM2.5 concentration increases the likelihood of having mental illness (including depression) by 6.67%. Hence, dirty air is not only suffocating your lungs, but it also impacts the way you think. There is clearly a desperate need to conduct in-depth researches to determine the extent of damage air pollution is doing to our mental health.The bottom lineFor now, instead of panicking over the stuffy air and AQI updates, it is more important to focus on what needs to be done. From carpooling, reducing the number of times you use your car, using public transport, planting more trees to completely avoiding burning trash, there is a lot that can be done on an individual level.

HP CM suggests to make pollution treatment plant mandatory for new industries,The Times of India (TOI),11/28/2019,SHIMLA,"SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that it should be made mandatory for all upcoming industrial units to have pollution treatment plant. He said that state pollution control board should also ensure that all the existing common effluent treatment plants should function properly so that water released downstream does not gets polluted. He said that special thrust should be laid on checking pollution in industrial towns like Baddi, Barotiwala, Nalagarh, Parwanoo and Kala Amb.While presiding over the meeting of Himachal Pradesh State Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Board at Shimla on Wednesday, Jai Ram Thakur said that work on improvement in functioning of existing common effluent treatment plant at Baddi, with respect to, connecting the convergence pipes to treat 1.10 MLD waste water from industries falling in river Sirsa catchment must be completed, at the earliest.He said that state government is committed to maintain pristine and salubrious environment in the state and would ensure that existing and new industrial units coming up in the State fulfil all the norms related to pollution control.He said that a proposal for setting up common effluent treatment plant at Kala Amb area in Sirmaur district, would be prepared to provide much relief to the people of area. 
He said that in addition to this, there was a proposal for setting up of solid waste management facility at Kala Amb.Jai Ram Thakur said that apart from water and solid waste pollution, concerted steps should also be taken to curb air pollution. He said that usually it had been felt that kutcha roads in industrial areas with heavy vehicular movement cause air pollution. He said that regular cleaning must be done of road dust and sprinkling of water on kutcha road through tankers.He said that trees should be planted along side roads and pucca pavements must be constructed along the roads. He said that efforts should also be made for developing green belts, gardens and parks in open areas so that people could be benefitted.He also directed the concerned authorities for ensuring proper design and laying of sewerage lines besides ensuring their proper maintenance.

Delhi-NCR air pollution: Task force suggests lifting ban on dirty-fuel factories,The Times of India (TOI),11/18/2019,GHAZIABAD,"NEW DELHI: As air quality improved on Saturday, the CPCB-led Graded Response Action Plan task force recommended lifting the ban on industries operating on coal in Delhi-NCR.""Industrial operations such as coal-based industries in Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Sonepat and Bahadurgarh, and non-PNG industries in Delhi, which were earlier banned by EPCA, may commence subject to taking adequate control measures and compliance to prescribed environmental norms,"" the task force stated.Supreme Court had on November 4 banned construction and demolition activities in the region till further orders. ""Hot mix plant, ready mix plants and stone crusher shall continue to remain closed,"" the task force stated on Saturday.As part of pre-emptive steps during the polluted Diwali period, SC-appointed EPCA on suggestions of the task force ordered ban on construction from 6pm to 6am from October 26-30. On October 31, the ban was extended four more hours from 6pm to 10am. 
On November 1, complete ban was announced before the apex court blanket ban.During the meeting on Saturday, officials noted how improvement in AQI was observed, which reached 'very poor' from 'severe' and 'severe plus' categories it was hovering around in the past few days.The state pollution control boards and other implementing agencies have, however, been asked to continue to remain on alert, ensure regular surveillance and take all necessary actions to curb air polluting activities.Earlier, on November 6, the Supreme Court gave Delhi government seven days to fix the 13 spots identified as the most polluted in the city.

"No more flush & forget, it's time for decentralised faecal sludge mgmt",The Times of India (TOI),11/20/2019,MUMBAI,"Mumbai: While crores of toilets have been built across the country, the question is: After you flush, what happens? The invisible underground activity that has long been associated with shame, caste and untouchability is finally being addressed with some urgency and being translated into government reports and targets.""The earlier thought was 'flush and forget' but now the government is trying to change that,"" says Arumugam Kalimuthu, programme director of the Water and Sanitation Hygiene Institute, a research and advocacy non-profit organisation. ""Current sanitation services are not keeping up with the amount of faecal sludge generated in cities, and there are enormous health hazards."" 
He refers to the need for a decentralised approach to the sanitation chain-emptying, conveying, treating and, possibly, recycling human waste-which is now being viewed as the best scalable model.Recognising the inadequacy of the sewer line network, the state government recently resolved to build 311 decentralised sewage treatment plants, starting with one in Nagpur. Some 74 plants are already operational in towns. Odisha also has fecal sludge treatment plants in seven cities and recently committed to scale up to 114 urban local bodies.The decentralised approach is based on a local faecal sanitation chain, which separates liquid and solid waste and treats them separately (see graphic). While treated solid waste is used as compost in agriculture, the liquid waste meets water needs. When treated correctly, human waste can be converted into useful byproducts, including fuel, fertiliser and irrigation water. The model is based on a treatment plant set up in Devanahalli, Bengaluru, by Consortium for DEWATS (Decentralised Wastewater Treatment Systems) Dissemination Society in partnership with the local government. The Rs 60-lakh plant can service 35,000 to 40,000 people.Government figures reveal that only 37% of the total 62,000 million litres per day of sewage generated in urban India is treated. Based on lastest census data, 32.7% of urban households are connected to a piped sewer system, whereas 38.2% dispose of wastes into septic tanks and about 7% into pit latrines, underlining the pre-dominance of on-site arrangements. Many septic tanks built by private operators are not properly lined at the bottom, according to the Centre for Science and Environment. Also, even if the outlet from a septic tank is connected to a stormwater drain, it could be a public health hazard as the liquid run-off needs to be channeled into soak pits or other appropriate systems. According to Energy Alternatives India estimates, India produces 1.2 lakh tonnes of faecal sludge a day, and 60% of it is dumped in water bodies or land. This results in water contamination and public health crisis. Experts point out that, like air pollution, the hazards of disorganised toilet management are class-agnostic.

Suggest out-of-the-box ideas to combat pollution: Naidu to scientists,The Times of India (TOI),11-01-2019,NAGPUR,"NAGPUR: Expressing concern over the rising air pollution in many parts of the country, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu urged scientists to come up with ""out-of-the-box"" solutions to combat the crisis.Naidu was speaking at the inaugural function of the two-day 15th international symposium on metal ions and organic pollutants in biology, medicine and environment organized by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) here on Wednesday. Naidu also launched Neeri's public outreach programme 'Jagruti-Ek Samaj, Ek Lakshya' which aims at creating a knowledge base of all rivers and lakes with public participation. Stressing that environmental pollution and deterioration of ambient air quality are one of the foremost challenges currently facing the country, Naidu said that environment degradation will have a direct impact on the development of the nation. Referring to the World Economic Forum findings, Naidu stated that the cost of environmental degradation in India was estimated to be Rs 3.75 trillion a year. 
He also cited the latest Centre for Science and Environment's State of India's Environment (SoE) report which highlighted that air pollution was responsible for 12.5% of deaths in India. ""The air quality index measurements in most of the major cities constantly register air qualities that are 'poor' or 'severe'. Air Quality in Delhi on Wednesday fell in the category of 'hazardous' with particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 soaring high. The numbers are indeed alarming and are a cause for great concern,"" said Naidu.On the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), he added, ""The programme will be a midterm, five-year action plan with 2019 as the first implementing year. The main aim of the programme would be 20-30% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024. Also, the metal ions and organic pollutants present in the air we breathe are extremely deleterious to health.""Suggesting another measure to reduce emissions, the vice president stressed the need to promote renewable sources of energy. He also advised regular cleaning, preservation, and maintenance of water bodies, which are ""turning toxic"" with increased urbanization. ""The CSE Report also estimates that 86 water bodies in the country are critically polluted, with both surface and groundwater being under severe stress. Groundwater is also facing over exploitation, there has been an unsustainable increase in the number of deep tube wells that has gone up by 80% between 2006-07 and 2013-14,"" said Naidu. Adding that around 70% of surface water in India is unfit for consumption, Naidu said, ""The quantity and type of metal ions present in water determine the possible health and environmental hazards. Detection and removal of contamination from water in a cost-effective manner must be our priority.""Terming cancer as a ""burden on India"" which has more than doubled over the last 26 years, the Vice-President stated that a number of studies have linked cancer to several environmental factors including pollution and radiation. ""The second-most common cause of death in India after cardiovascular disease must receive attention from both doctors and policymakers.The key to curing cancer is early detection, in which imaging plays a crucial part. We must also constantly innovate and create new, less invasive treatment protocols for cancer that are affordable and accessible,"" he said, urging scientists to translate research and development in local languages to benefit the people. In his address, Neeri director Rakesh Kumar said that though the environmental standards so far formulated are linked with health, medical professionals and environmental scientists do not come together to discuss environment and health issues. ""Neeri has made this attempt through this symposium,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

In fact, Bengaluru's air quality has been better compared than that of other cities like Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai, for the past few days.Though Bengaluru doesn't have to deal with problems like stubble burning, vehicular emissions do contribute heavily to air quality, which deteriorates before and during winter. Experts say intermittent rain in the past few weeks has helped Bengaluru maintain better air quality as showers arrest the impact of dust and other pollutants to a large extent. 
Interestingly, during three rain-free days early this week, the air quality did worsen a bit. Air quality is considered good when the AQI is below 50 and satisfactory when it's within 100. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (which got no rain), it hovered around 150.Lokeshwari H, scientific officer with Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), said air quality in Bengaluru is comparatively better these days with AQI staying in the satisfactory zone. ""Usually, it starts getting poorer during the end of October and November, and pollution levels peak in December, January and February,"" she added.Nagappa B, an air quality expert and former senior scientific officer with KSPCB, said reduction in air pollution when it rains is known as wet precipitation. ""Suspended particulate matter and other harmful chemicals in the air get dissolved, resulting in better ambient air quality whenever it rains. In the absence of precipitation, pollutants get accumulated,"" he explained.A senior official with KSPCB said Bengaluru received copious rain due to the extended monsoon and impact of cyclones. ""Even now, the city is witnessing rain because of the onset of northeast monsoon. However, the air quality may not remain good for long. As rain recedes and winter sets in, Bengaluru will also choke as it does every winter,"" he added.Box: B'luru and air pollutionAQI: Good (0-50), Satisfactory (51-100), Moderate (101-200), Poor (201-300), Very Poor (301-400), Severe (401-500)AQI in Bengaluru over past few days: Nov 7 (155), Nov 6 (154), Nov 5 (130), Nov 4 (81), Nov 3 (71), Nov 2 (68), Nov 1 (65), Oct 31 (52), Oct 30 (64), Oct 29 (80)Source: KSPCB, CPCB For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Don't scrap double-decker buses, activists urge Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray",The Times of India (TOI),12-10-2019,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: Transport experts on Sunday demanded that the 72 double-decker buses which are to be scrapped should be replaced with ""double deckers only"", and suggested that the fleet could be maintained at 100 twin-deck buses. TOI recently wrote about BEST's plan to scrap 72 double-deckers and replace them with single-decker buses, primarily due to ""huge operational costs"". A final call on the replacement will be taken soon. The double-decker buses completed 82 years of service in Mumbai on Sunday.Commuter rights activists Irfan Machiwala and Mustaq Ansari wrote a petition to CM Uddhav Thackeray, stating that ""these iconic buses should be visible on road"". The petition also mentioned: ""BEST should ignore losses and preserve the buses for their heritage value. 
Many prefer the front seats of the upper deck as you can simply enjoy the cool breeze. It is a refreshing experience. More double-decker buses should be purchased.""A member of the Mumbai Mobility Forum, A V Shenoy, said, ""We should not completely phase out double-deckers, but maintain at least 100 of them which can be operated in areas where there is not much of a traffic issue.""Transport expert Nikhil Desai said double-deckers were a pride of Mumbai. ""They should continue to operate in areas such as Marine Drive, near Gateway and other tourist spots,"" he said. Vidyadhar Date of Aamchi Mumbai, Aamchi BEST said if London can have several double-deckers, why can't Mumbai. ""It's not just about transport, it's a heritage of the city which needs to be preserved,"" he suggested.Machiwala added, ""These buses are able to provide a high seating capacity in a limited space. They occupy less road and carry more passengers. Air pollution will reduce when more double-deckers are introduced.""Ansari said, ""BEST double-deckers were launched to cope with the increasing number of commuters in buses and were modelled along the lines of London's red double-decker buses.""

Air quality suffers for sixth straight day,The Times of India (TOI),12/30/2019,LUCKNOW,"Lucknow: The steady rise in air pollution levels continued for the sixth consecutive day in the city on Saturday with the increase in the density of fog and chill.The Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday touched 340, an increase of 19 units over Friday's 321. The AQI reading on December 22 was 349, which dropped to 278 on December 23. Thereafter, the AQI started rising again December 24 onwards, increasing by 20 units on an average. Experts said that it may touch the 401-mark by December 31, sending the city into the 'very poor' category.The AQI is average of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration in the air over a period of 24 hours. 
The reading is said to be 'good' if the value is between 0-50, 'poor' if it's between 201 and 300, 'very poor if it's between 301 and 400 and 'severe' if it's above 400. The AQI had dropped on December 23 because of strong easterly winds. However, the wind pattern changed and cold winds from snow-fed mountains in Himachal Pradesh started lashing the city. They led to the formation of fog, which combined with pollutants in the air to form smog.""This smog enveloping the city is responsible for the rise in air pollution,"" said Dhruvsen Singh, director of Lucknow University's weather and pollution monitoring cell. ""The situation is likely to aggravate till December 31 as weather conditions are expected to remain conducive for smog, he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Rain betters city's air quality index from poor to satisfactory,The Times of India (TOI),12/15/2019,BHOPAL,"Bhopal: Rain seems to have the ""magic"" formula to control air pollution. Moderate rain in Bhopal on Tuesday evening didn't bring the temperature down as much as the air quality index (AQI). According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the AQI, which stood at 235 on Tuesday, showing ""poor"" air quality in the city, dropped to 78, showing air quality to be ""satisfactory"".Small and bigger particulate matter (PM-2.5 and PM-10), which are the major sources of air pollution in Bhopal, came down to 72 and 78 from 235 and 173 respectively. On Monday, the air in Bhopal was all the more polluted with an AQI of 275, presence of PM-2.5 at 275 and PM-10 at 221.What does the rain do to improve air quality?Environmentalist, Subhash C Pandey, said: ""In scientific terms, the process is called precipitation. 
As it rains, dust, hazardous particles and gases settled down on the surface of the earth and the air in the atmosphere gets cleaner. It is like ""dirt"" spread in the atmosphere settling down. This is the reason why in European countries and coastal areas, pollution is not so much a problem. Because in every two-three days, there is rain in these areas and the air is cleaned. By the time pollutants build up again, it rains again.""But, it is not rainy season anymore. Tuesday's rain was a one-off occasion. It's winter, a season when air pollution reaches its peak as the air becomes heavy and does not go up in the atmosphere. ""Smog"" in Delhi is the best example of this phenomenon.Barring Wednesday, when the AQI dropped significantly according to the CPCB data, the AQI throughout the month of December has been ""alarmingly"" high.While CPCB records AQI at T T Nagar, the M P Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) records it at six points in the city -- two in residential areas, one industrial and three commercial areas.While CPCB figures are available real time, the MPPCB figures are not available so promptly. MPPCB figures for six points, where it records AQI, is thus available till December 10 and that, too, not on a day-to-day basis.The six points, where the MPPCB records AQI, include Paryawas Bhawan (residential), civil hospital, Bairagarh (commercial), CETP Govindpura (industrial), Kolar police station (residential), Hamidia Road (commercial) and Barkatullah University (BU), Hoshangabad Road.MPPCB's AQI figures show Kolar to be the worst place in terms of air pollution with the AQI touching 301 on December 10, which is in ""very poor"" category. Govindpura, despite being an industrial area, has air pollution in check with AQI in ""poor"" category only twice in four days, when the data was recorded.While it is no surprise that Hamidia Road, perhaps the most crowded and congested market place in Bhopal, is in the ""poor"" category, according to the AQI, Bairagarh and Hoshangabad road (both commercial areas with heavy traffic, dust and crowded streets) having AQI quite similar to Paryawas Bhawan in Arera Hills (in moderate category) are also in the same category.The chief chemist at the MPPCB regional office, Dr Sangeeta Dani, when contacted for comments, said: ""Air quality depends on several factors like vehicular traffic, quality of roads, wind flow in that area, surroundings, greenery and open space. Hoshangabad Road has heavy traffic but it has open spaces. Hence, dust and particles kicked up by vehicular traffic don't remain confined there but disperse, therefore reducing the AQI. Hamidia Road, on the other hand, is a closed area and dust or other particles remain stuck there, they don't go away.""Subhash C Pandey, however, was not convinced with the explanation. ""Their data has always been ""erratic"". They are never reliable. There always seems to be contrivance to show good air quality. How can Arera Hills have the same AQI as Bairagarh or Hoshangabad Road? Maybe there are open spaces on Hoshangabad Road, but that alone can't ensure good air quality in an area,"" he said.

"Reject CAA, focus on jobs: CM",The Times of India (TOI),01-04-2020,DELHI,"New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the central government and the entire country should reject the Citizenship Amendment Act and focus on employment instead. ""This is not a Hindu-Muslim issue,"" Kejriwal said, responding to question at a town hall organised at Maharaja Agrasen College in east Delhi. Commenting on his absence from the protests against CAA and National Register of Citizens in the capital, Kejriwal said he was trying to ensure that there was no violence anywhere and the agitation remained peaceful. 
""My job is to maintain peace in Delhi and ensure its development. I was taking all steps necessary to ensure that there was no violence or police excesses,"" the CM said. Questioning the necessity for the citizenship law at this juncture, he said: ""It says that even Hindus will have to leave the country if they don't have identity documents for themselves and their parents... The economy is down and the unemployment rate is high. Our children don't have jobs and houses. They (Centre) say they will bring in two crore Hindus from Pakistan. Where will they be settled?""At the fourth of the seven planned town halls, Kejriwal presented the five-year report card of his government and said that if AAP was re-elected, the priority of his government would be to clean up the Yamuna, make Delhi the cleanest city of the world and address air pollution. ""Cleaning up the Yamuna is our priority for the next five years. The river is polluted by sewer and industrial waste from the city. We have identified and planned a waste-management system. I assure you that, in the next five years, we will clean up the river. I will be the first one to take a dip in the river,"" Kejriwal said. Asked whether he was confident about AAP winning the election, he said: ""AAP will win in Delhi. We are witnessing different voting patterns in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls."" Among the audience, Gautam Maya Gupta from Kondli lauded the efforts of Delhi government at improving the living conditions of people in unauthorised colonies. ""We have got roads, sewer pipelines, water and power connectivity in the last five years,"" she said. Manvi, a Class XII student from School of Excellence in Khichripur, said government schools' infrastructure and facilities were now at the same level as their private counterparts. Kejriwal also highlighted the improvement in the performance of students from government schools in board examinations. An emotional Meenakshi shared her experience of getting a compensation of Rs 1 crore when her policeman husband died in line of duty in 2017. Kejriwal said that, earlier, only a sewing machine was given as compensation to such widows, but now AAP government was not only giving them a compensation of Rs 1 crore but also the title of a martyr.

2 more air monitoring stations to become functional today,The Times of India (TOI),1/14/2020,PATNA,"PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has installed two more continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations at Patna and Hajipur, which would be operational from Monday (January 13). A proposal in this regard has been sent to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The new stations will be linked to the national grid soon, an official at the board said.The new stations have been set up at DRM office in Khagaul and government office in Hajipur town area. One more air monitoring station will be operational by this month at Government Boy's High School in Patna City. The installation work is underway.The stations would provide information regarding the ambient air quality along with individual readings of seven parameters, including PM 2.5 (particulate matters less than 2.5 microns), PM 10 (particulate matters less than 10 microns), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone and Ammonia (NH3). It will also show the temperature, humidity, wind speed and other climatic conditions of the day.The new air monitoring boards are procured from a US-based company, which cost around Rs1.15 crore each.The state capital presently has four monitoring stations at Eco Park, Planetarium, Birla Institute of Technology-Mesra at Patna and SK Memorial Hall.BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told this newspaper that the installation work of monitoring stations have been done and it will be soon connected with the CPCB server. 
""The city's overall air quality index (AQI) would now be calculated on inputs from five monitoring stations. It will give the clear picture of air pollution in the city,"" he said.""At least 10 monitoring stations are needed in a city like Patna to get a broader scenario with regard to air pollution. With four stations in city, we have covered only 70% area of the city,"" he added.Ghosh said two more stations have been proposed at Kankarbagh and Digha.Besides Patna and Hajipur, a monitoring station each will also come up at Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Gaya and Muzaffarpur by December-end. The state government is also planning to set up 42 monitoring stations in different cities of Bihar.The BSPCB, in association with other organizations that works for environment, had prepared a comprehensive action plan. It also conducted a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution in Patna. The source appointment study is now taking place at other two districts, including Gaya and Muzaffarpur. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Noisier nights across Bengaluru, and we may well pay a steep price",The Times of India (TOI),02-11-2020,BENGALURU,"BENGALURU: Nights in Bengaluru are no longer quiet. In fact, data of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board for June-December 2019 show that in some areas, noise levels at night are double the prescribed standard.The area near Wilson Garden, close to Nimhans, is a case in point. It houses one of the 10 continuous noise monitoring stations installed by KSPCB in different parts of the city. Though the area is categorised as a sensitive zone as it has hospitals, the average noise level at night is 75% more than the prescribed limit. 
The figure is more than double during day.The noise levels at night were 97% more the prescribed limit at this station last December, a record of sorts for any area in the city. The movement of interstate buses in the area is a major factor for this dubious record.It's the same with the monitoring station at RVCE, Mysuru Road, another sensitive area as it's home to an educational institution. Here too, vehicular movement on the adjacent highway coupled with ongoing Metro construction work are to blame for the high noise levels.Nights are no longer peaceful in Bengaluru's residential areas either. In Domlur, BTM Layout and Basaveshwaranagar, where the pollution control board monitors noise levels, nights are way too noisier than ever before. Interestingly, increasing noise levels have pushed citizen groups in Indiranagar, Koramangala and a few other areas to seek the court's intervention.The night noise level data for commercial areas like Church Street, Marathahalli and Yeshwantpur are also not a happy story as the figures exceed the prescribed level.H Lokeshwari, chief scientific officer, KSPCB, analysed the worrying development. ""It means that vehicular movement, commercial operations, construction activities, etc. that generate noise have increased at night. While this is inevitable in a growing city, one cannot rule out violations like high noise levels in pubs and construction activities. This needs to be fixed,"" she said.She went on to say, ""We're in the process of collating more data on noise pollution hotspots in the city. Once it's done, specific guidelines will be issued to departments concerned to take up necessary interventions.""Whitefield quieterInterestingly, data show that noise levels at night are well within the prescribed limits in industrial areas like Whitefield and Peenya. ""While it's understandable in Peenya where most industries are shut at night, there are serious doubts about Whitefield data as there's always vehicular movement, etc,"" said environmentalist Diwakar K.He points out a factor which should be taken into consideration the way noise levels are monitored. ""For silent areas like hospitals and educational institutions, the prescribed limits itself is very stringent, around 50 decibels. However, for commercial areas the level is 75 decibels,"" he said.Traffic cops in line of fireTraffic police are among the most vulnerable to noise pollution as they are continuously exposed to vehicular honking.A senior traffic officer said noise pollution is impossible to control unless the government comes up with strong policies.""Round-the-clock vehicular movement, work on building infrastructure, commercialisation of residential areas, pubs and other establishments not adhering to noise standards are some reasons why noise levels are high even at night,"" he added.""For those with high blood pressure, increasing noise levels are a threat as it increases their heart beat. For police manning traffic, noise levels have become a health concern. To protect ourselves from air pollution, there are masks but there is no device to save them from noise pollution,"" he added.

3K runners gear up to hit the tracks at half marathon,The Times of India (TOI),02-07-2020,KOLKATA,"Kolkata: Around 3,000 people are expected to converge on Red Road on Sunday morning as the Times Half Marathon is flagged off, promoting the importance of a clean environment.Debanshu Dasgupta, director of Straightline, which will curate the event, said the response have been great. ""Over 2,500 entries have already registered and we expect another 1,000 people to join the event."" Participants can register on www.timesmarathonkolkata.com. Echoing Dasgupta, Prasanta Saha, the race director, said, ""Words about the event have spread wide. 
It is a run for a cause, a run for the City of Joy.""Sudhir Ahuja, a sports enthusiast, is looking forward to this event. ""I am a regular marathon runner, having completed over 20 half marathons and two full marathons across India,"" he said. Equally excited is model and a trained mountaineer, Madhabilata Mitra. ""Running is the best way to stay fit, calm and focused,"" she said, adding she tries to motivate others to participate in marathons. Samir Agarwal, an investment banker by profession, took up running seriously around four years ago. Since then, he has taken part in a number of 10km marathons and about a dozen half marathons. He aims to run a full marathon in future.Rana Dasgupta, CEO, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals in Kolkata, said, ""This run also stands for something else that is extremely topical in these times: the message that we should do our best to keep the city air clean. We are all aware of the poor air quality index (AQI) in Kolkata and most other urban areas of India. Air pollution around the world is poor but we have to start addressing the issue somewhere. Let us all pledge to do our own bit and not contribute to the rising pollution. We can do this by performing simple tasks, like ensuring our vehicles confirm to the latest emission norms, avoiding bio-mass burning and making sure we do not add anything that would be harmful to the environment.""Public relations and communication consultant Swati Poddar, a fitness enthusiast, is all geared up for the Sunday event, which will have three categories of 3km, 10km and 21km runs. ""I have been running for six years now. I got a chance to test my own limits,"" she said.Abhishek Lodha has an advice for people who are yet to decide on whether to participate or not. ""To realize your true potential, you have to first find your limits and then muster the courage to go past them,"" he said. Another enthusiastic participant is Bharat Bagla, a financial planner.

"Amid coronavirus scare, Kolkata begins to heal its air and water quality",The Times of India (TOI),3/23/2020,KOLKATA,"Deserted roads, vacant offices, malls sans customers and anxious residents cooped up in their homes -the past few days have taken a toll on human activities around the world, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. While we are flooded with upsetting news coming in from all quarters, slowly but surely a highly positive environmental revolution of sorts is taking place in Kolkata. The city, as it seems, is beginning to heal, what with significantly lower pollution levels, cleaner water bodies and rare birds and butterflies making a comeback.Air is cleanerIn November last year, Kolkata's air was fouler than Delhi's, with theaverage air quality index (AQI) going well past the 400-mark at Ballygunge. It prompted health experts to advise restrictions on outdoor activities,particularly morning walks. 
Currently, the city's average AQI is between 70 and 110. ""These figures indicate pure bliss. While discussing air pollution, we mostly talk about particles in the air that cause all types of physical illness. With lesser traffic and human activities, the suspended air particles aresignificantly lower in the atmosphere now,"" said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB). Similar readings were recorded on Holi due to a traffic slowdown.The skies are getting clearLower amount of suspended particles in the air has led to better visibility too. This is giving photographers and stargazers a much clearer view of Kolkata's skyline and night sky. Kaustuv Chowdhury, secretary general of Kolkata Astronomy Centre, said, ""Though we have suspended all meets keeping in mind the coronavirus threat, all our members are stargazing from their respective homes. The stars are much brighter due to the clear sky. Justyesterday, I noticed Venus looking even brighter than usual.""Rare birds fly back to the cityLower pollution levels are attracting more birds to the city, including rare ones. According to Swarup Saha, a bird watcher, birds are sensitive to pollution and there have been several sightings of rare birds in Rabindra Sarobar in the last 10 days, much more than compared to recent years. ""Large hawk-cuckoo, blue throated blue flycatcher and ultramarine flycatcher are among the most interesting birds spotted recently. This is probably the first time a large hawk-cuckoo has been spotted in Kolkata,"" said Swarup.Ornithologist Sumit Sen said one of the reasons for the increase in bird sightings is the reduced numbers of cars as well as humans on the streets. ""Thanks to lower sound pollution, birds are now coming down on the ground to find food. This has increased the feeding hours for them,"" he added.Water is cleanerNot just air, the city's water bodies are looking cleaner too. With lesser industrial waste and human activities, there's been a possible reduction in pollutants going into the Hooghly. According to Kalyan, a monthly water test is conducted by WBPCB and the board will be able to reveal the actual data only after testing the Hooghly water next month. However, Bapi Halder, a fisherman and secretary of a south Bengal-based fisherman association, said they have noticed about 5% to 10% increase in the number of fish in the Hooghly. ""Many are now sceptical about fishing due to the coronavirus scare. That is helping the fish population grow, especially the small ones. Besides, the water purity has improved with all the big trawlers and boats gone,"" he said. More butterfliesInsects, known to be highly intolerant to pollution, are also finding their way back to the city. Somenath Pal Das, who specialises in butterfly gardens and breeding butterflies, said the number of butterflies in his garden has multiplied in the last one week. ""Though I haven't spotted any rare species yet, the numbers are significantly higher than what I saw even two weeks back,"" he said. Species like common mormon, common lime, common palmfly and common rose are being sighted commonly now. ""Declining pollution levels is the most prominent reason for this. Besides, with fewer vehicles on streets, insects are much more confident to come out of their hidings since collision with high-speed cars is one of the biggest reasons for butterfly deaths,"" he added.Around the world#In New York, carbon monoxide, mainly from cars, reduced by nearly 50% compared to last year#China's greenhouse gas emissions over the month of February are as much as a quarter below normal levels#A near shutdown of cruise and cargo-ship traffic around Venice has resulted in fish returning to the Venice lagoon and canals for the first time indecades For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Evoke: Good opportunity to mitigate climate change,The Times of India (TOI),4/23/2020,TOP STORIES,"On Earth Day, Times Evoke begins Evoke Inspire, a unique forum for young readers to express their ideas on the environment and global existential issues.Writing for Evoke Inspire, Siddhant Nigam Sinha, a student at Philips Academy Andover, and founder of the SUN Foundation, discusses steps towards a more sustainable world.In these trying times, our news feeds are overwhelmed by reports from around the world of the huge costs of Covid-19. We hear of hospitals inundated with patients, health workers facing enormous strain, individuals battling extreme circumstances. In the midst of this, however, one ray of hope has emerged - global greenhouse gas emissions have declined and air and water quality has improved in multiple places. In India, for instance, a decline in factory production, air traffic and construction activity have together reduced pollution, leading to noticeably cleaner skies. Astonishingly, the Himalayas were recently visible from Jalandhar, a city hundreds of kilometres away, while numerous reports indicate how rivers like the Ganga and Yamuna are much cleaner today.
Read other stories of Times EvokeHowever, global carbon emissions have seen this decline only due to the current pandemic. In China, as people stayed home and factories contracted output, emissions dropped reportedly by 25%, which translates to around 200 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. Some forecasts similarly suggest that European emissions this year could also be nearly 400 million tonnes less than last year.However, seemingly positive though they are, these changes are in no way sustainable as they have come not due to planned actions but on the back of a global crisis, causing unprecedented economic disruption. Last month, as economic activity contracted, a record 10 million Americans reportedly filed for unemployment benefits. In rural and urban India, a large number of business owners and workers face sharply reduced sources of income while economists predict the damage caused by the corona virus could take economies years to recover from. Climate positives that are an outcome of such emergencies, and enormous human distress, are clearly not sustainable.Yet, this moment offers us a chance, of thinking of ways to save our world from the impacts of climate change in the near future. A silver lining today is that many people around the world are finally turning to science and facts, rather than opinions or stands, for information on the corona virus. This presents an opportunity to orient more people towards learning and trusting the science on climate change as well, and thinking of innovative solutions and preventative measures, based on such science.To stand a chance against climate change, we need to implement sustainable and planned structural changes. Importantly, we must reduce our reliance on coal, a major contributor to global carbon emissions. In addition, we must transition to environmentally-friendly energy sources, such as solar power or wind energy. Combating climate change also requires multilateral action as emissions from any country have a global impact. Once this crisis passes, restoring economic health will be vital for all the nations of the world. But this moment gives us all a chance to think of new and better methods to reorganise our economies, in a way that cleaner air and less polluted rivers do not become a thing of memory, but are a lasting positive from this experience. The youth of today must inherit a world where forethought, planning and global cooperation can save us from yet another catastrophe. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

First study of air pollutants: Chandigarh finds 7 keen firms,The Times of India (TOI),05-01-2020,CHANDIGARH,"CHANDIGARH: Seven companies are interested in doing the city's first source appointment study of the proportion of pollutants in the air. After the lockdown, the administration will invite them for discussion.The UT floated the expression of interest (EoI) with the approval of administrator V P Singh Badnore. Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) member secretary T C Nautiyal confirmed the number of bidders who say they can identify the main factors behind air pollution in the city. 
The study will use Rs 80 lakh out of Rs 10 crore given to the city under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).In 2017, the Union environment ministry had decided to use Rs-5-crore-worth Swiss device for the study in four cities. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, had procured these machines and one of those was proposed to be installed in Chandigarh. In 2018, the administration rejected the proposal because of high cost but, by then, it had floated the expression of interest, seeking partners for the study.Recently, the administration had also filed with the Union government its action plan to control air pollution in Chandigarh. The UT cited its campaign against polluting vehicles and presented a blueprint of work to widen the roads. The design included synchronization of traffic signals, greening of open areas, introducing tertiary-water-fed fountains at major intersections, promoting battery-operated vehicles, building green buffers along traffic corridors, and introducing an intelligent traffic management system.The UT submitted that a 60% increase in vehicle count over 10 years (with no change in the length of roads) had fouled the city's ambient air. Cars alone have increased by more than 100% in this period, while the city has 48% more two-wheelers. Vehicular density has caused congestion, which has led to air pollution, to which construction and demolition waste, dust, stubble burning, pollen due to greenery, temperature effect, and industrial surroundings have also contributed.The government aims at cutting pollution level by 35% in the next three years and 50% by the next five. Chandigarh is on the list of 100 targeted cities that have a high proportion of nitrogen dioxide, besides particulate matters 2.5 and 10. The air-quality study will look at particulate matter, ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide (CO) among other factors. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

PCB gives industries license relaxations,The Times of India (TOI),6/30/2020,INDORE,"INDORE: Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board has relaxed the three months intimation period for auto-renewal of licenses for orange and green category industries.Water and air consents to operate for green and orange category industries shall be auto-renewed for 5 years and 1 year respectively on the basis of a self-declaration form without the need for a three-month intimation period and physical inspection, said Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board.Until last year, industries had to inform the board three months in advance for auto-renewal, and this facility was available for alternate renewals with mandatory inspection for license renewal after a year of auto-renewal.Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board Indore regional officer RK Gupta said, ""Industries of the state have received relaxation from three months intimation for auto-renewal. This year licenses for all orange and green category industries will get auto renewed even if they had availed this facility a year ago. This is done to facilitate industries struggling in tough Covid times.""Industries will have to upload a self-declaration form on the board portal stating that air and water pollution levels are under control and details on expansion, products and others.Industries' associations were demanding government to auto-renew licenses from every department amid the outbreak of pandemic. 
They claim small and micro scale industries will be benefited immensely through this relaxation.An industrialist from Indore Ashok Badjatiya said, ""If the industry is clean and following all laid norms, it's their right to get their licenses auto-renewed. Just talking about ease of business will not help but eased measures should be implemented to aid industries growth.""Industry players said the requirement of documents for renewal of licenses should also be curtailed to avoid delay and ease the process of licensing.

City's air action plan lacks sources of pollution: Analysis,The Times of India (TOI),07-01-2020,NAGPUR,"Nagpur: The city's clean air action plan does not contain information on the sources of air pollution and also lacks a legal mandate for implementation.This was revealed in the latest independent analysis released on Tuesday by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Urban Emissions. Under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which is a statutory body of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), had identified over 100 polluted cities where the prescribed standards for ambient air quality are violated.The city's plan, which has been approved by CPCB subject to some compliances, revealed that post 2006, citizens have been breathing toxic air, with the deadliest pollutant Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) surpassing the national permissible limit.According to the analysis, only 20% of the interventions mentioned in the city's plan call for on-ground pollution control measures. ""Over 80% of the actions mentioned in the plan involve overseeing, planning, proposing, preparing, investigating, identifying, ensuring, banning, initiating, launching, planning, restricting and promoting. 
Also, 38% of Nagpur's action strategies are directed at the transport sector and 20% target industries,"" the analysis stated.During the lockdown, the only real-time monitoring station in the city reported a 30% decline in PM2.5 concentrations. ""However, to tackle air pollution in the city in the long-term, a single monitoring station for a city with over 2 million population is insufficient. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the Nagpur Municipal Corporation must collectively prioritize the setting up of more monitoring stations and creating trackable indicators to oversee the progress of implementation of this plan,"" said Tanushree Ganguly, a researcher at CEEW and a co-author of the study.The analysis also finds that the city's plan lists 66 measures across 17 different agencies. While the MPCB is responsible for only 20% of all actions, the urban local bodies and state transport department share the burden of almost 60% of the actions. Moreover, 34% of actions fall under multiple agencies. Furthermore, the estimates suggest that 21% of the pollution in Nagpur could originate outside city limits. However, the plan does not include any measures to ensure regional coordination,"" the analysis added.Stating that over 30% of the activities are shared across multiple agencies, Kurinji Selvaraj, a researcher at CEEW and co-author of the study, said, ""Fragmentation of accountability is a key impediment. Hence, it is crucial to delineate specific tasks for each action point among participating agencies.""As per the study, only five non-attainment cities in the state - Amravati, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Chandrapur and Mumbai - of the 17 with approved action plans contain information of emission sources.

Bihar's air quality enters safe zone: BSPCB study,The Times of India (TOI),8/29/2020,PATNA,"PATNA: The Covid-19 lockdown may have inconvenienced many, but it has had a positive impact on the overall pollution levels in the state, especially in capital Patna, with air quality entering the 'satisfactory' zone from 'severely polluted' before the lockdown. In a study carried out by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), the impact of the lockdown on the ambient air quality of major cities in the state, including Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, and Hajipur, has been assessed.The study, which is still under progress, collected real-time pollution data in three phases - pre-lockdown Phase 1 (March 12- 21), Phase 2 (March 23-April 19) and Phase 3 (April 20-April 27). It examined the trends of major air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.10) and traced atmospheric gases (NO2, SO2, NH3, Ozone, and CO) before and during the Covid-19 lockdown. BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said the findings of the study conclude an overall improvement in the air quality of the state since the implementation of the lockdown on March 22.""The overall air quality of the state has been improving gradually since the lockdown. 
On March 21, the AQI of Patna was 300, while the concentration of prominent pollutant PM2.5 stood at 300. A month into lockdown, the AQI of Patna dropped down to 76 on April 27 and PM2.5 concentration was 20. It's a very positive development,"" Ghosh said.According to the national ambient air quality standards, all 11 air monitoring stations across the state have shown air quality index (AQI) of major cities including Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur to be either good (0 - 50) or satisfactory (51 - 100) since early April.Attributing the improvement in the air quality to the combined impact of several factors, including low vehicular and industrial emissions, during the lockdown Ghosh said, ""The NO2 and SO2 concentration in the Patna is usually high, but with the implementation of restrictions on travel and factories, the levels of these gases were well below the permissible limit.""Simultaneous lockdown in the adjoining states and early arrival of monsoons in the state this year also contributed to the improvement in overall air quality and decrease in air pollutants, he added.""We don't have much industrial activity in Bihar. A major portion of air pollution in our state was neighborhood pollutants from adjoining states of UP and West Bengal, which were carried by the winds to Bihar. Post lockdown, we noticed a decrease in neighborhood pollution along with the bordering districts of Bihar,"" he said.""Additionally, with the early arrival of southwest monsoon in the state, there was a decrease in air pollutants as most of it settled on the ground due to the rains,"" he added.According to the AQI bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board on Thursday, the AQI of Patna was 41 while that of Gaya and Muzaffarpur was 23 and 62 respectively.

Punjab plans to shift brick kilns from coal to CNG,The Times of India (TOI),09-01-2020,CHANDIGARH,"Chandigarh: Tandrust Punjab Mission director Kahan Singh Pannu has said the state government will explore the possibilities to shift brick kilns from coal to compressed natural gas (CNG) to check air pollution. There are around 2,200 active brick kilns in Punjab.Pannu said the state government had earlier succeeded in shifting most of the active brick kilns to the approved design of high draught zigzag technology, which uses lesser coal as compared to the traditional brick kiln firing system.""But, technological advancement in combustion systems has now made it possible to convert even the coal-based brick kilns into CNG-based kilns without much change in their design,"" he said. Therefore, under the Tandrust Punjab Mission, the state government intends to explore the possibilities of shifting brick kilns from coal to CNG, said Pannu.Brick kilns in Punjab use about 16 lakh tonnes of coal to produce about 1,100 crore bricks every year. 
Although the improved zigzag technology requires lesser coal, still a lot of coal is used for firing the kilns, which is a source of pollution. It was in this context that the Punjab State Council of Science and Technology had been requested to come up with a technology that would replace coal in the brick kilns with CNG, Pannu said, adding that the Punjab Pollution Control Board could also provide necessary assistance in the process.CNG is now amply available in Punjab and a large number of coal-based industrial units are shifting to gas-based units. The shift of brick kilns to CNG would not only help reduce the cost of production of bricks, but also substantially reduce the air pollution load caused by coal-fired kilns, Pannu added.

High-intensity blasts at quarries damaging homes,The Times of India (TOI),10-05-2020,VIJAYAWADA,"Vijayawada: Locals of Donabanda under Nandigama mandal in Krishna district have stopped work at quarry sites and taken to the streets in protest against the use of explosives for quarrying.Locals alleged that high-intensity blasts are damaging their houses and causing pollution and associated health complications. Srinivasa Rao, a resident of Donabanda, said the quarry managements are using ammonium nitrate and other explosives that lead to air pollution while dust from the quarry has given rise to respiratory and digestive problems in locals, he said.Sheik Khaja, another resident, said he had a new house constructed two years ago but every wall has developed deep cracks. ""We fear for the safety of our house if the situation continues like this,"" M Nageswaramma, a local, said her house has also developed cracks at multiple places.Locals alleged that the quarry managements have violated norms by digging rigs with depths of over 100 feet and is stuffing the rigs with high-intensity explosives to mine large quantities of gravel. Despite several representations, official action is yet to be taken, they said, appealing to the mining department to order an inquiry into the issue and take action. The quarries are maintained by two private companies. When contacted, the additional director (AD) of the mining department was not available for comment. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Forget 100%, fly-ash utilization of Koradi & Khaparkheda below 30%",The Times of India (TOI),10/13/2020,NAGPUR,"Nagpur: On one hand ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has allowed use of high ash coal and on the other, the power plants near Nagpur are unable to achieve 100% fly-ash utilization. The fly-ash is being dumped in ash bunds and during heavy rains, it flows into rivers poisoning Nagpur's water supply.Data analysed by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) reveals that the fly-ash utilization of Koradi power plant in 2017-18 was only 13.14%, 2018-19 - 29.12% and first half of 2019-20 - 22.89%. The corresponding figures for Khaparkheda plant are: 2017-18 - 35.56%, 2018-19 - 14.24% and first half of 2019-20 - 20.81%. According to Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA, such less utilization of ash at power plants despite multiple timelines for 100% utilization shows how these big polluters are multiple offenders of all rules and regulations, impacting health of citizens. ""Recent multiple accidents and ash pond breaches alongside huge water pollution, air pollution, livelihood displacement and stranded asset problems show how this highly fossil fuel-based power generation choice is a detriment to our society at large and how it is a must for us to clean operation of these coal based power plants and shift aggressively to sustainable renewable energy options,"" he said. 
On August 6, fly-ash from Waregaon ash bund of Khaparkheda plant got discharged into Kanhan river forcing Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to stop pumping for four hours. At that time Khaparkheda CE Prakash Khandare had stoutly denied that there was any leakage of fly-ash from Waregaon.A few days ago, Pratap Goswami, district organization secretary of Aam Admi Party (AAP), went to Waregaon ash bund and found fly-ash flowing out of it after rains. He clicked photographs and provided them to TOI.A Mahagenco spokesperson claimed that while ash bund overflow the ash did not get discharged into Kanhan river. ""Downstream there is a sump and pump house and the fly-ash laden water was pumped back into the bund,"" he told TOI.Goswami disputes this fact. ""Fly-ash may not have got discharged on that particular day but city's water supply was hit due to fly-ash in Kanhan river in August,"" he said.Goswami further said that fly-ash was carcinogenic and caused many ailments among humans. ""NMC should lodge a police complaint against Mahagenco for discharging fly-ash into Kanhan and contaminating the city's water supply. It should realize its responsibility and stop protecting Mahagenco officials,"" he added.Former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule had tried to ensure utilization of Mahagenco's fly-ash by setting up a fly-ash industrial cluster near Koradi. The plan was to invite brick manufacturers to set up their kilns in the cluster and make them use fly-ash in bricks.However, the plan failed to take off as brick kiln owners refused to move into the cluster complaining that plot sizes allotted to them were not adequate. The local authorities - Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) - were expected to evict them from their locations near residential areas but this activity did not progress beyond notice stage.

"Gurugram's air very poor again, control room set up for complaints",The Times of India (TOI),10/29/2020,GURGAON,"GURUGRAM: The city's air pollution levels were in the 'very poor' category on Tuesday. While an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 320 was recorded at the Teri Gram and Sector 51 monitoring stations, it stood at 277 (poor) at Vikas Sadan.
Track the pollution level in your cityThe stations are monitored by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), which shares the data with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). HSPCB officials said that climatic conditions have led to a peak in air pollution levels over the past week. ""The decrease in the temperature and wind speed has caused the increase in air pollution levels,"" said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, Gurugram.Singh said the city's air quality in the coming days will depend on the weather conditions as well as the level of stubble burning in neighbouring areas. Meanwhile, a control room has been set up for handling complaints related to air pollution in Faridabad and Gurugram with a dedicated helpline and nodal officer under the graded response action plan (GRAP). The control room for Gurugram has been set up in IMT Manesar. Residents can file complaints on toll-free number 18001800091 and via WhatsApp on 9717990677. Emails related to pollution can be sent to hspcbmc@gmail.com.After a few months of clean air, the air pollution levels in the national capital region have increased amidst increasing farm fires. GRAP measures, including a ban on diesel generators, came into effect in Delhi-NCR from October 15. While Gurugram got relief from the ban, the rest of the restrictions are being implemented.""We are taking all the measures as directed by the EPCA including construction ban and night patrolling. All the measures are being implemented by the agencies concerned with the district administration as the nodal agency,"" said Singh.

Delhi: Spraying water may not get you clean air,The Times of India (TOI),11/26/2020,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Various government bodies have been spraying several lakh litres of water across the capital to combat pollution and settle dust. However, experts said not only could this be resulting in wastage of water, but also negatively impacting air quality if spraying was not being done at a high pressure.In 2019, IIT-Delhi professor Mukesh Khare had written to the three municipal corporations stating that none of them were spraying water at a high enough pressure to reduce local air pollution, stating a fine ""mistlike"" spray was required to achieve that. While antismog guns may be more efficient in achieving the purpose, experts said targeting high dust areas was a more efficient way of reducing pollution and saving water.So far, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) has sprayed over 70 lakh litres of water since October 17, when it began the drive following orders from Delhi government. 
The agency has been concentrating on reducing pollution at Delhi's 13 pollution hotspots and spraying over two lakh litres of water daily through 15 fire tenders and 45 personnel. While DFS has been spraying water at a high pressure, other agencies are slowly catching up.Khare, in his letter, stated that the corporations required retrofitting and a change in the nozzle type to improve water pressure. This winter, the corporations have deployed over 250 water sprinklers, 45 by east, 83 by south and 130 by north.A senior corporation official said they had increased the nozzle pressure for spraying disinfectants on streets and buildings for Covid-19. The same setup was now being used for sprinkling water.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, at Centre for Science and Environment, said no study had indicated that sprinkling water was effective in reducing air pollution and for how long it would work.""Spraying of water needs to be done in dusty areas. However, we first need to find a systemic solution to the problem and identify major dust-generating areas. Water cannot be sprayed at each location as it will simply amount to wastage. Construction agencies also need to be made accountable so that they don't dig up an area and leave it exposed,"" added Roy Chowdhury.Sumit Sharma, director, Earth Science and Climate Change Division at The Energy and Resources Institute, said anti-smog guns were a more efficient way of settling dust and the priority should be on construction sites and surrounding areas. ""We need water sprinkling at large construction sites and locations with substantial dusty materials as dust can become airborne when winds pick up. Smog guns not only use less water, but release it in the form of a spray,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

BJP Asks Govt To Refrain From Cracker Ban,The Times of India (TOI),11-09-2020,RANCHI,"Ranchi/Bokaro/Jamshedpur: The government must not ban use of firecrackers for Diwali alone and in case it does choose to restrict fireworks for the Hindu festival, the same should also apply for Christmas and New Year, BJP's Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth said on Saturday.Adding that he, being the people's representative, understands that the pollution and smoke emanating from the fireworks could pose a threat to public health amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Seth, who won the Ranchi Lok Sabha constituency for the first time last May, said, ""I am also concerned about public health and safety, but everyone's religious sentiments should be respected equally. The state government should take these into consideration and not just disrespect or offend one particular religion and its festival while issuing any guidelines,"" he added.Talking to TOI amid the debate over use of crackers in the wake of concerns raised by medical experts, Seth said, ""I am opposed to any such ban if it is only for Diwali. Let's ban it during festivals celebrated by other communities as well. Why only during Hindu festival?
Ban it on December 25 (Christmas) and New Year when more crackers are used than Diwali.""Meanwhile, RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) also has urged the state to refrain from imposing a blanket ban on crackers on Diwali. Only firecrackers imported from China cause pollution, but governments in various states have been banning all crackers without a proper study on their effects, it said.SJM's regional convenor Sachinder Kumar Bariar said, ""Chinese crackers, imported illegally, have potassium nitrate, sulfur and other harmful chemicals that cause pollution. There are made-in-India eco-friendly crackers in the market that are free of any chemicals. These green crackers are certified by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - NEERI. It is unfair of the governments to impose a ban on all types of crackers on Diwali.""Recalling a Supreme Court order in 2018 which permitted crackers for two hours on Diwali to continue with the tradition and livelihood, he added that thousands of livelihood are dependent on the cracker industry and trade during Diwali,.Meanwhile, with just a week left for Diwali and a fortnight for Chhath, the state government is still to clear its stand on how the two festivals will be celebrated even though doctors have been warning the government about complications for Covid patients and also those who have recovered due to spurt in air pollution due to the use of crackers with the onset of winter.Former chief minister and BJP national vice-president Raghubar Das has written to chief minister Hemant Soren seeking early notification of Covid-19 guidelines for Chhath festival, which takes place six days after Diwali on November 14, to clear the confusion prevailing among organising samitis.Das aid, ""Lakhs of Chhath devotees are keenly awaiting the guidelines to prepare (for the festival) accordingly. The government should announce the festival norms at the earliest."" Several Chhath puja organising samitis recently told TOI that they are waiting for the government to issue guidelines so that they start work pertaining to sprucing up Chhath ghats and prepare puja material packets for distribution among devotees.Meanwhile, Chas Municipal Corporation (CMC) in Bokaro has floated a WhatsApp number (9939069533) seeking suggestions from residents on the ways to host the festival safely amid the pandemic. CMC chief Shashiprakash Jha said, ""The step has been taken to take ideas from the citizens to prepare our own standard operating procedures. The Covid pandemic is not over and we need to be vigilant while celebrating.""He added that they will start preparations for the festival next week. ""It is certain that Chhath this year will not be organized like previous years. It will be mandatory for everyone to comply with safety guidelines,"" he said.With inputs from Divy Khare in Bokaro and B Sridhar in Jamshedpur For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

While Gandhinagar area of Hazaribag recorded the highest noise level, a few locations in Ranchi and Jamshedpur recorded lesser levels, signalling adherence to the guidelines issued by the state government in only a few areas.The JSPCP data said Gandhinagar recorded up to 122.5 dB between 7 and 8 pm followed by Bank More area at 102.7 dB between 6 pm and midnight. 
Hirapur area of Dhanbad also recorded 101.8 dB.In the city category, Dhanbad topped the chart at 101.6 dB followed by Hazaribag at 85.38 dB. Ranchi with 73.17 dB came third and Jamshedpur was placed fourth with 69.20 dB.All areas in Ranchi, Dhanbad and Hazaribag also reported an increase from the ambient noise levels. In Jamshepur, only the Tata Memorial Hospital reported a lesser level at 57.01 dB. In the state capital, the worst noise levels were reported from Albert Ekka Chowk (79.25 dB), Kutchery Chowk (74.04 dB), Ashok Nagar (71.28 dB) and areas near the high court (67.75 dB).The board also tracked air pollution levels across Ranchi from its pre-installed devices. The air quality index (AQI) in the city went up to 484 micrograms per cubic metre which was 128 on November 9 and remained below 133 till Diwali day.Elderly residents said they had faced difficulty and did not expect people to burst so many firecrackers during the Covid times.Sharda Devi (84), a resident of Morhabadi, said, ""Even though I was indoors, the sound of firecrackers could be heard past midnight and it was a for me as I am a heart patient. It increases my anxiety attacks and breathlessness.""Dr Jitendra Kumar, a doctor who stays in Bariatu, said he was in shock after people continued to burst firecrackers even in enclosed spaces. ""People need to exercise restraint as bursting crackers will also harm them. During the pandemic time, we need to ensure that the air around us is without pollutants.""

Left Democratic Front pins hope on Clean Eloor plan,The Times of India (TOI),11/22/2020,KOCHI,"KOCHI: The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Eloor is hoping to return to power highlighting the success of 'Clean Eloor' programme, which won the municipality several accolades since its launch in 2017.LDF claims that it made progress in decentralized treatment of household waste through disbursal of biopots and biodigesters.The LDF is approaching the voters with a request for continuity in governance based on the development work they have undertaken in the municipality and promising that Eloor would be made the cleanest municipality in India, in league with Indore.The housing project they introduced which provided homes to 25 families belonging to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe is another achievement. The post-flood cleaning they undertook and the municipal town hall built at Pathalam are also being highlighted.But the UDF, which completed its seat-sharing process without much glitches, feels that the front was an abject failure when it comes to solving vexed issue of water availability in Manjummal and northern part of the island municipality.The LDF also could not reinstate the health insurance scheme and all announcements so far remained hollow promises, according to councillors.Of the 31 wards, Congress is contesting in 28 wards with coalition partner IUML in the fray in the remaining three seats. The CPM is contesting in 23 seats with the rest going to CPI. 
NDA, which had won two seats in the 2015 election, is contesting in 16 wards. While BJP candidates have been fielded candidates in 15 wards, one ward has an LJP candidate.Eloor municipality often enters news because of the impact of industrial pollution on air and the two rivers that surround it - Periyar and Muttar. Not a month passes without reports of fish kill or colour change in the river stretches surrounding the local body. But green activists feel that the issue of environmental degradation has never received attention of political parties, who saw an agenda of shutting down industries in it.

'Barter' scheme to check stubble burning in Unnao,The Times of India (TOI),11-10-2020,KANPUR,"KANPUR: The Unnao district administration has launched a unique 'barter' scheme to find a permanent solution to the practice of stubble burning by farmers.""Under the scheme, the farmers will be provided one trolley of bio-fertiliser against the submission of two trolleys of stubble across 135 'gaushalas',"" district magistrate Ravindra Kumar informed TOI on Monday.For over five years, burning rice stubble has caused severe air pollution in the region.Estimates show that 15-20 million tonnes of paddy stubble burnt in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh emit PM2.5 that is 4-5 times more than the annual PM2.5 emissions from all vehicles plying in Delhi.Acting tough, over 1,100 FIRs have been lodged against 2,000 farmers across the state for stubble burning.Thirty-five-year-old Sanjay is a rice farmer in Gadan Kheda village and he hasn't burnt rice straw after he came to know about the barter scheme. ""I am preparing bundles of rice straw to further transport it on my tractor-trolley to a 'gaushala' to exchange it with bio-fertiliser,"" he said.Earlier, he used to burn the stubble.""I had also availed the barter scheme of district administration. Such an initiative will not only lessen the increasing pollution level, but the bio-fertiliser provided by the 'gaushala' authorities will also increase my yield, besides our stray cattle will now no more die of hunger due to sufficient fodder stock across the 'gaushalas' in the district. 
Also, one will also not land in a legal tussle,"" said Shiv Kumar, another farmer.""We have received an overwhelming response from the farmers. There are in total 135 temporary 'gaushalas' in the district. Nearly, 1000 quintals of stubble had already been received by officials across these 'gaushalas'. It's an effective solution to the problem of burning stubble and it will only make the soil more fertile,"" the DM said.""Also, directions have been given to the revenue department officials to spread awareness among farmers against stubble burning and for proper disposal of crop residue by involving village committees and village heads,"" he added.

"'Cracker ban is an administrative decision, needs right implementation'",The Times of India (TOI),11/14/2020,NAGPUR,"Q.What is the effect of bursting crackers on air quality? • Millions of people burst crackers during Diwali which leads to immense pollution and smog in the air. Firecrackers mainly consist of sulphur, carbon and other chemicals for colouring and binding effects. Post the bursting and explosion of firecrackers, the chemical components, metal particles and dangerous toxins are released in the air and these toxic components stay for hours, contaminating the air and deteriorating the air quality index. 
Q. What are the changes in air quality seen during the festival of Diwali?• On festival day, the average concentration of particulate matter 10 increases 35 times compared to a normal day before Diwali in cities like Vadodara and New Delhi. Similarly, concentration of sulphur dioxide has increased 23 times and NOx has increased 3 times on festival day. The trends vary in different parts of different cities. Q. How serious is the pollution caused due to firecrackers? What are its effects on human health? • Fireworks contain chemicals such as arsenic, sulphur, manganese, sodium oxalate, aluminium and iron dust powder, potassium perchlorate, strontium nitrate, barium nitrate and charcoal. Burning of firecrackers releases pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particles and several metals such as aluminium, manganese and cadmium, which are associated with serious health hazards. Q. What are the most dangerous components of firecrackers? • Among the pollutants, PM 2.5 particles are considered the most harmful as they are able to enter deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. This can cause short-term health effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath, and in the long-term can affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease.Q. Is pollution from firecrackers worse or more impactful during winters? What about industrial and vehicular pollution? • Air pollution is worse in the winter months (October-January) as particles remain suspended in the air for longer duration of time due to the lower temperature, wind speed as well as higher relative humidity. Pollution due to firecrackers adds to this air pollution. PM 2.5 particles are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles and power plants and some industrial processes. The increased air pollution levels during winters is a combination of all the above components. Q. We have seen that bans do not work effectively. Will a ban on crackers work? • A ban is an administrative decision which needs proper implementation and execution. A ban on firecrackers has an impact on air pollution levels as well as the livelihood of many working in the production of firecrackers. We need to understand the importance of reducing air pollution levels irrespective of a ban is in place or not. The committed efforts from all of us can help avoid health issues related to air pollution due to firecrackers. Q. Does bursting crackers affect people of all age groups? What are the short-term and long-term damages of this exposure? • Populations of certain age group are more susceptible to ambient air pollution due to firecrackers. This is more important for children and senior citizens who can experience irritation in the eyes, nose and increased chances of asthma attacks. Also, people who have recovered from Covid may end up having complications of severe cough and breathing difficulty. Q. What should be the general precautions to be followed by everyone during this festive season with regard to Covid? • Cases of Covid have sharply decreased in comparison to the past few months but there might be a second peak in the total number of cases. It is imperative that we don't let our guard down during the coming few months. There are some precautions to follow during the festival season. Avoid crowding in closed places. Parties with many people in closed rooms can be a source of spreading the Covid infection. If necessary meet in open areas restricting the number of people. The mask is often removed during eating food or having a drink. This can be a source of transmission. People should restrict to staying with close family members so that we can have more celebrations in the coming years. Carelessness on our part can cost the health of our near and dear ones which might ruin the festivities and celebrations.

"Eluru 'mystery' ailment: Are veggies, fish the culprits?",The Times of India (TOI),12-12-2020,HYDERABAD,"Hyderabad: Available laboratory data points towards vegetables and fish as the possible source of poisonous contaminants in the samples of patients suffering from what has come to be known as Eluru 'mystery' disease. Pollutants in milk and other dairy products too may have contributed to the development of acute symptoms in over 500 people in Eluru town.A scientific analysis of the laboratory reports and data on water and air pollution released by the state government makes it amply clear that water and air samples did not contain heavy metals. Those consuming bottled water and people in villages, where municipal tap water is not served, are also affected. 
Official data showed high levels of lead and nickel in some of the blood samples.If water and air are not the source of lead, nickel, or heavy metal poisoning, then the contaminants must have entered the bloodstream of the patients through food, say researchers. Vegetables, particularly leafy ones, and fish are known to gather heavy metals and pesticides from the earth through a process called bioaccumulation. A number of research studies have revealed the presence of heavy metals and pesticides in vegetables, fruits, and leafy vegetables like Gongura (Hibiscus sabdariffa) and Thotakura (Amaranthus), both local delicacies.Similarly, researchers had also found heavy metals and pesticide residues in fish collected from Krishna and Godavari delta. In this backdrop, the report of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), which collected vegetable samples, will hold the key to solving the mystery.The government statement referring to mass convulsions in patients clarified that there was subsequent decrease of lead content in the blood after the patients were admitted. ""This indicates that this is a case of acute exposure and not chronic exposure. This basically means that at this point in time it seems like a one-time spurt,"" it said.

Five reasons why you should adopt cycling in 2021,The Times of India (TOI),1/28/2021,FITNESS,"Let's face it, we all spent 2020 stuck at home practicing social distancing. While there are a lot of expectations from 2021, there is also a realisation that as individuals we would need to do better to look out for ourselves and our loved ones. One such recommended addition to our lifestyle, which Indians are already inclining towards, is cycling. 
As we venture outside and look for alternatives to stay healthy or commute, cycling presents itself as a sustainable and practical solution. Whether you pick this up as a hobby, a routine or to protect the environment, there are several benefits of this amazing activity. Yogendra S Upadhyay, CEO, AlphaVector India Pvt. Ltd. share benefits of daily cyclingKeeping fit without access to gyms or studios? Not a problemCycling has always been one of the top 5 exercises anyone has ever picked up to keep fit. It increases your heart rate and helps you burn calories faster than most exercises and also helps you build muscle in the process. One hour of cycling can help you burn anywhere between 400-1000 calories depending on the intensity and weight of the rider. So if you're wondering how you can keep fit when most gyms and fitness studios are closed, cycling is the answer for you!It helps you build your lung healthDid you know, WHO has mentioned in their COVID 19 handbook that people with stronger lung capacity and a healthy respiratory system are less likely to contract COVID? Cycling helps you boost your lung health by exponential levels and helps you develop a stronger respiratory system. Cycling makes your lungs inflate and deflate faster than the usual rate pushing more oxygen in your blood and boosting your metabolism. If you cycle for longer periods, it helps in boosting your stamina and strengthens your immunity.Fix your sleeping issues with daily pedalingIt's not too hard to decode, tiring yourself will definitely make you sleep better at night, but with cycling, it has been proven. The researchers at the University of Georgia, studied men and women from the age groups between 20 to 85 years to find out that the reduction in physical anxiety brought by cycling helps in elevating the ability to sleep.It helps improve your mental well-beingExercising can boost your mood in so many ways, from the basic release of endorphins and adrenaline to improved confidence in achieving new physical goals. Cycling, being an outdoor exercise also gives you time for yourself and gives you a sense of calm. A study by the YMCA showed that people with an active lifestyle had a wellbeing score 32 percent higher than inactive individuals. For consistent cyclists, it works like meditation and helps them concentrate.It's your small contribution to helping the environmentBy using your cycle as your daily travel companion you solve multiple environmental problems. Automotive vehicles are a major cause of air pollution, noise pollution and overcrowding in our environment. By using a cycle for your day to day travel, you can contribute to the environment and solve all these problems at a personal level. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Think of all the good you can do for the environment just by taking the initiative to use bicycles as your daily driver, and all the money that you save on the fuel expenses can be put to other use! Even better, invest in an e-bicycle! For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Clearing The Air: Here's Why 2020 Was Not All Bad,The Times of India (TOI),01-01-2021,DELHI,"New Delhi: All attention was focused only on the insidious coronavirus during the passing year, so not many realised that in 2020, Delhi enjoyed the most good-air days of the past three years. There were 192 days when the PM2.5 level was below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. In contrast, there were just 120 such days in 2018 and 145 in 2019, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences. 
The year was also better than the past in terms of PM10 levels, with 116 days in 2020 recording levels below the NAAQS of 100 micrograms per cubic metre against 55 days in 2018. Experts also pointed out that while 2020 was less polluted than 2019 and 2018 mainly due to the Covid lockdown, the long-term trend showed a gradual improvement in air quality each year. However, while Delhi's air was cleaner this year, the pollution level was still higher than permissible. SAFAR's analysis noted that the annual average PM2.5 level in 2020 was 83 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the acceptable norm of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. In 2019 and 2018, the annual averages were 95 and 99, respectively.The winter months of November and December too logged better PM2.5 levels than in 2019 and 2018. The combined average PM2.5 this year was 176 micrograms per cubic metre against 197 in 2018 and 184 in 2019.""The period from March to July was primarily affected by the lockdown, but there was drop in air pollution in January, February and August. The air quality deteriorated from October to December, with the winter months recording high levels of PM2.5 and PM10,"" said a SAFAR official. ""Farm stubble burning, local pollutants and firecrackers during Diwali were compounded by meteorological factors in causing the deterioration in air quality.""Centre for Science and Environment's assessment of winter pollution until November showed overall PM2.5 average lower than in the previous year largely due to the disruption in economic activities during the lockdown. But with the reopening of the economy coinciding with the onset of the winter, PM2.5 levels spiralled in October-November.The CSE analysis found the cyclical ups and down of pollution this winter more volatile, showing a quicker rise and fall than in the previous winters. This could also be a reflection of changes in local pollution patterns and overall downward trend when aided by meteorological factors. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said, ""Though the long-term pollution levels are seeing a downward trend, we need to take more steps to ensure the pollution is below the standard limit throughout the year.""

MoU inked to check pollution through artificial intelligence,The Times of India (TOI),02-11-2021,PATNA,"PATNA: The state will now use artificial intelligence and remote sensing technology to spy the main sources of air pollution and take action against the violators.To begin with the new initiative, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Under the MoU signed online by BSPCB chairman Dr Ashok Kumar Ghosh and India based representative of the UNDP Shoko Noda, the BSPCB would use the Geo AI platform developed by the UNDP Accelerator Lab and the University of Nottingham.Ghosh told this newspaper that the BSPCB would use the 'digital solution' technology for identifying the faulty brick kilns, places of stubble burning and urban areas with loads of pollutants emitted by vehicular traffic in all the 38 districts.However, the initiative will begin with the brick industry in the state. ""Of the total 6,000 brick kilns, about 1,000 are yet to follow the new zigzag technology to check emission of pollutants. As most of them are situated in far remote areas, it was not possible to physically inspect all. 
Now, the artificial intelligence will pinpoint their location,"" said Ghosh.Though stubble burning is not a common practice in Bihar, some cases were reported from Supaul and Nawada, he said.The major cause of air pollution in the state is the emission from vehicles, which in the event of traffic congestion and humid weather, increases much. Ghosh said the BSPCB has 11 monitoring stations and 24 under the process of installation. The artificial intelligence technology would, however, help identify the lanes and roads under heavy load of air pollution at different times, he said. ""About 40% of deaths worldwide were due to air, water and soil pollution and the BSPCB, concerned over this fact, has now started using space intelligence to check it in the state,"" Ghosh said.

Air pollution back to pre-pandemic levels in Karnataka,The Times of India (TOI),02-07-2021,HUBBALLI,"HUBBALLI: A study conducted by Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found air pollution has returned to, or even exceeded, pre-pandemic levels during the winter season in the five southern states.Air quality improved dramatically during the nationwide lockdown, but pollution levels steadily rose during the second half of 2020 which coincided with restrictions being eased and economic activity resuming. It wiped out the gains made on the environment front during the lockdown.The study finds Karnataka has the highest total burden of health costs. Air pollution has spiked in Hubballi, Chikkaballapura, Vijayapura and many other cities after the onset of winter.Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager, CSE's Urban Lab team of Sustainable Cities programme told TOI that, generally, winter isn't harsh in the southern cities.""Yet pollution build-up has been noted,"" Somvanshi said. 
""Although the average level of PM2.5 for the summer and monsoon months in 2020 was considerably lower than in previous years, PM2.5 levels this winter have risen beyond that of 2019 in most cities. The region cannot rely only on the natural advantage of warmer winters and sea breeze to avoid bad air.""The analysis is based on publicly available granular real-time data (15-minute averages) from the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) official portal. Somvanshi said the air quality trend does not include investigation of local sources of pollution.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, CSE, said the study dispels the myth about safer air in the south compared to other regions.

AAP targets Centre for letting air panel ordinance lapse,The Times of India (TOI),3/17/2021,DELHI,"New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Monday attacked the Centre for failing to legislate an ordinance that the government itself had promulgated to form the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region, thereby causing it to lapse and the body to cease to exist. Claiming that the ordinance was the only step the Centre had taken to tackle Delhi's air pollution, she alleged that BJP was not serious about the crisis.""Delhi deals with pollution on an annual basis. There are two sources of this pollution - one emanates from within Delhi, and the other, from outside,"" Atishi pointed out. 
""A TERI report mentioned around two years ago that about 60% of Delhi's pollution came from outside. As soon as the stubble burning season begins, it becomes increasingly difficult to breathe,"" she said, adding that Delhi government was constantly taking steps to control pollution in the city.""With providing 24x7 electricity, the dependency on generators reduces. We have drawn up a hugely progressive electric vehicle policy, are providing ample charging stations, subsidies and also shifting towards clean fuel,"" the MLA said. Delhi is the only state in the country to completely shut down thermal power plants, she added. ""We also have the Green Delhi application, which aims to control dust across the city."" An ordinance needs to be legislated into law within six weeks of a parliamentary session. This ordinance lapsed last Friday. Atishi said, ""I would like to ask the central government, what is it doing to control the pollution that's coming from states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan? Why has the central government taken no step towards controlling or preventing this pollution? Why is Delhi being forced to live in pollution?"" It's only issuing constant directions, the Kalkaji MLA added. The commission was not even given any office space or staff, the MLA said.

"Maha forests on fire in Jan-Mar, heavy loss of wildlife habitat",The Times of India (TOI),04-06-2021,NAGPUR,"Nagpur: Most of it is red and less green. The satellite imagery obtained from the Forest Survey of India (FSI) on Sunday shows how forests are on fire, causing huge habitat destruction for wildlife and damage to our environment that will aggravate problems caused by climate change. According to FSI statistics, Maharashtra continues to be one of the leading forest fire-prone state with a number of fire incidents doubling from 22,499 in 2019 to 44,809 in 2021. These fire alerts are mostly for the period from January to March. ""The year 2020 was a silver lining with overall 6,342 alerts owing to rains. 
All these fires are man-made ahead of season for tendu plucking and mahua flowers collection,"" said senior forest officials.Gadchiroli circle, where tendu leaves interest is high, tops with 16,800 fire alerts, followed by Thane (5,857), Chandrapur (4,847), Kolhapur (4,616), Nagpur (2,270), Pune (1,850) and Yavatmal (1,581). Fires are being reported from even tiger reserves and sanctuaries that are considered to be most protected. There were 1,028 fire alerts in Wildlife (East) consisting of Tadoba, Pench, Bor and Navegaon-Nagzira in 2021.State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, ""The data of fire monitoring shows zero fires in 2020 at several places. This may be due to stringent lockdown last year. Though fire season in Vidarbha starts in February, most of the fires occur in March ahead of the tendu season. The 2021 fire data portrays a grim picture and calls for a need to tighten protection mechanism in the areas where there is an increase in fires as the next two months are crucial.""According to environmentalist Suresh Chopne, forest fires no more remain confined to damaging only forest and wildlife. ""Its environmental damage cannot be calculated in monetary terms. The large-scale fires expose chink in the armour of the forest department. Fires are largely of anthropogenic origin and therefore preventable to a large extent. Despite spending crores of rupees on prevention and getting real-time alerts, the state forest department has failed to control them.""""Chandrapur district is already the most polluted district in the country due to polluting industries and coal mines. These forest fires increase air pollution. The district exceeds in particulate matter and forest fires will further worsen the situation, causing trouble for villagers,"" said Chopne.According to various studies, said Chopne, the annual losses from forest fires for the entire country have been moderately estimated at Rs450-500 crore. ""This estimate does not include the loss suffered in the form of biodiversity, nutrient and soil moisture, and other intangible benefits,"" he said.Eco-Pro president Bandu Dhotre said, ""There are many forest fires this year. This raises doubts whether fire protection works were done or not owing to funds crunch. There are several fires at one spot and seems to be an act of revenge.""""These fires have affected plantations and vegetation in a big way. From an ecological point of view, these fires are dangerous. High smoke concentrations can also be a very serious matter, particularly near homes of people with respiratory illnesses or near healthcare facilities,"" said Dhotre.Sources said Bramhapuri division witnessed huge fires affecting tigers and their prey.

"Drive to plant 33L saplings to begin on June 5, says Rai",The Times of India (TOI),06-03-2021,DELHI,"New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said that on the occasion of World Environment Day, Delhi government will launch a mega plantation drive of around 33 lakh saplings of trees and shrubs. Rai said the government will plant a large number of roadside shrubs to combat air pollution and bring down PM10 levels.""This time, the Centre has set a goal of planting 18 lakh trees but Delhi government has kept a goal of planting 33 lakh trees, which we will symbolically initiate on June 5, given the city is under partial lockdown. In the coming days, this programme will be operational on a larger scale,""Rai said. 
The minister said in 2017, Delhi's green area covered 299 km, which increased to 325 km, and they are hopeful that this year's tree plantation drive will further increase this to an area of about 350 km. Every year, the central government provides an afforestation target to states. ""During elections, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised to achieve the goal of planting 2 crore plants in the next five years to improve the environment. Keeping that goal in mind, we had surpassed the Centre's goal and set a target of planting 31 lakh trees last year. However, we are happy to report that we surpassed our own target and planted 32 lakh trees in the last year against the target of 15 lakhs given by the Centre,"" he said.Rai added, "" We will plant immunity-boosting and medicinal plants beginning June 5. It is my appeal to Delhiites to take these plants from governmental nurseries and plant them at their homes and increase their immunity levels by consuming them.""

New tech reduces flat construction time to less than a year,The Times of India (TOI),7/26/2021,INDIA BUSINESS,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 66% of the 6,368 affordable houses being built under the Light House Projects (LHPs) using new technologies, which PM Narendra Modi talked about in his Mann ki Baat on Sunday, have their factories at far off places from their actual sites. Most parts of the projects are being done in controlled factory environments that ensure good finishing and completion of these buildings in less than a year. These pre-fabricated parts are brought to the sites for assembling.A total of 3,284 multi-storey flats being built at Agartala, Lucknow and Rajkot have their factories at Indore, Bhopal, Bhilai and Pune. 
Similarly, for another 1,024 flats under construction at Indore, the work is in full swing at factories in Nagpur, Pune, Hyderabad and Bhilai.This is for the first time the government has taken up six pilot housing projects using new technologies to build multi-storey flats up to 13 floors across six cities in just one year, primarily focusing on pre-fabrication technologies. The companies executing the projects recently assured the PM to complete them within the set timeline.Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed the real time progress of these projects with the live feed from drones deployed at factories and project sites. The pilot projects were launched by the PM on January 1 to promote large adoption of new technologies for faster construction""These technologies will provide solutions to many issues including maintenance, painting the flats and pollution at project sites as most of the work is done in a factory controlled environment. Construction is one of the major contributors for air pollution,"" said an official.In Rajkot, monolithic concrete construction technology from France is being used to make the houses strong enough to face natural disasters. Similarly, Canada's technology is being used in Lucknow, which will not require plaster and paint.In Chennai, the pre-cast concrete system technology from the US and Finland is being used to construct houses faster and cheaper. In Ranchi, flats are being built using the German 3D construction system just like Lego toys. Each room will be built separately before creating the whole structure.In Agartala, houses are being constructed with steel frames using New Zealand's technology to combat earthquakes. This technology is best suited for areas having higher earthquake risk. Due to poor soil condition at site, piling up to 30 meters depth is done for structural safety.Highlighting how new technology can accelerate construction of houses, Modi said, ""There was a time when it would take years to complete even a minor construction. But today due to technology the situation is changing in India. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Stubble burning: UP selects 868 cases for withdrawal,The Times of India (TOI),8/28/2021,LUCKNOW,"Lucknow: A day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced to withdraw cases of stubble burning pending against farmers, the state government on Thursday shortlisted 868 such cases lodged since January 2020 in which chargesheets have been filed against the accused.As per records available with UP Police, around 1,500 FIRs were lodged against farmers in 38 districts. Of these, the chargesheet was filed in 868 cases while the remaining were either closed with a final report for absence of evidence or expunged for one reason or the other. 
In all, over 2,500 farmers were named as accused. Maximum 165 cases are from Kheri where chargesheets have been filed. Last year, the Supreme Court had directed all the district police chiefs to coordinate with other departments to curb stubble burning which was leading to air pollution.Another officer in the home department said apart from withdrawal of cases, the decision on refund of fine, running into several crores of rupees, will also be considered. A senior police officer said that these cases are usually registered under the sections of not obeying an order passed by a public servant along with Indian Penal Code sections like making atmosphere noxious to health, negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter and also National Green Tribunal sections. All these are non-cognisable offences which have mostly fine and imprisonment of very less duration.A farmer leader, who wished not to be named, said the move will bring relief to the farmers. Last year when cases of stubble burning were not stopping, the government had also instructed the local police outpost incharges to spread awareness among farmers for not burning stubble.

First is the range. How far an EV can travel once charged and secondly its cost. 
EVs are costlier than regular petrol or diesel vehicles. If we are going for a shift to EVs we need to keep these two factors into consideration. Hence, for policymaking, it's essential to introduce innovative ideas to make EVs affordable for the public and work with companies to enhance the range of these vehicles.""He said that there are subsidies and incentives offered by the state governments in other states to encourage selling of EVs.

NCR Planning Board gives another month to states to respond to proposals on Regional Draft Plan 2041,The Times of India (TOI),09-01-2021,INDIA,"NEW DELHI: The NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) on Tuesday gave another one month's time to the participating states to submit their comments before putting the Regional Draft Plan 2041 in public domain for consultation as states sought more time to respond to the proposals. The proposed plan envisages major infrastructure projects and increased economic activities across the region.Sources said Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who chaired the meeting, flagged how delay in finalising the Regional Plan won't be acceptable this time while highlighting how some years were lost when the last Regional Plan for 2021 was prepared.TOI has learnt that only Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was present in the virtual meeting while all the three other states were represented by their ministers. Sources said Khattar flagged his concern over how a large share of the state's territory has come under the jurisdiction of NCR.Officials said no other major issue barring the Draft Regional Plan was taken up in the meeting. 
In an official release, the housing and urban affairs ministry said Puri urged the NCR participating states to adopt and implement the recommendations of the NCRPB's plans and make use of its funding window available at very attractive rates, which will help in achieving accelerated growth and development of all sectors in the region.It said the Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments signed the Combined Reciprocal Common Transport Agreement (CRCTA) for Stage Carriage and Contract Carriage for seamless movement of passenger vehicles in the NCR. ""There will be single point taxation for all motor cabs/ taxis/ auto rickshaw; all stage carriage buses, all State Transport Undertakings (STUs) of NCR, including city bus services. This will encourage shift of traffic from private vehicles to mass public transport vehicles and will help in to ease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution,"" the ministry said.

She said that air pollution and sedentary lifestyles were also leading to stroke among many people. 
Addressing an awareness programme jointly organized by ISA and Rotary club of Guntur, Rotary club of Aadarsh, Rotary club of Guntur Vikas and Rotary club of Guntur Centennial on Sunday, Dr Vijaya, director of Lalitha Super Specialty hospitals group, observed that people should keep their hypertension and blood pressure levels under check to overcome the ill-effects of stroke. She said that keeping away from smoking and alcohol would immensely help prevent stroke. She said that people with heart diseases, high cholesterol levels and obesity should be very careful to safeguard themselves from falling victims to the stroke. ""Everyone can know about their risk through the Stroke Riskometer App, which is available in the play store. Take all possible measures to prevent stroke and take assistance from a doctor soon after getting doubt about a possible stroke,"" suggested Dr Vijaya. She said that the ISA has taken up aggressive campaign to help save lives. She said that they wanted to stop the first attack among people with risk factors through the campaign and second attack after a person suffers with TIA or stroke.

"Navi Mumbai: Why were 26 trees razed at MIDC plot in Pawane, asks NCP activist",The Times of India (TOI),10/15/2021,NAVI MUMBAI,"NAVI MUMBAI: A senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) activist has raised a serious environmental issue with MIDC over the shocking destruction of 26 green and healthy trees from a Pawane land plot that was earlier allotted to Shree Ganesh Forgings Limited industrial company.Talking to TOI, NCP's national general secretary (minority department) Saleem Sarang said, ""Since February this year, I have been formally asking the planning body, MIDC, as to how and why over 26 big trees were fully razed at the Ganesh Forgings plot that was later given to the Goodwill group to run their business. However, till date I have not got a proper explanation or response on why the trees were killed or shifted elsewhere. Some of these tall trees were within the protected 3-metre borderline periphery of the plot C-3/C, still they were illegally removed. 
This is highly harmful for the environment, but the authorities are least bothered.""Sarang further added, ""`Today (Thursday) I personally met the state deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, to complain about how green trees are being brazenly killed without any fear of law, such as at this Pawane plot. After researching on this issue, I also got to know that earlier an FIR was done against unknown persons for killing a tree at the Goodwill group plot at Vashi sector 17, where the landmark Apna Bazaar building once stood. If MIDC still fails to reply to my queries, then I will be forced to move the Bombay high court, for the sake of greenery and protection of our city trees.''When TOI contacted the MIDC regional head, Satish Bagal, on this tree issue, he said, ""I will have to check the file documents of the Ganesh Forgings plot (now handed over to Goodwill group) to know more about the trees matter.""RTI activist Anarjit Chouhan commented, ""MIDC is the planning body for the industrial zone in Navi Mumbai. Hence, they are responsible for the number of trees in all their plots. If anyone has hacked trees or even transplanted them, the planning body must take note of it and act as per the environmental laws. If no action is taken against culprits, then our green tree cover will continue to reduce, which will be our loss in our fight against air pollution.'' For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

How GMDA plans to stop roads from being dug up for infrastructural work,The Times of India (TOI),10-06-2021,GURGAON,"Gurgaon: In a bid to restrict excavation and open digging and preserve green belts, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to make the use of ""trenchless machines"" mandatory in the laying of underground utilities in areas within its jurisdiction.Trenchless machines enable the installation, removal, or maintenance of utilities by minimising or removing the need for open excavation. GMDA officials said the machines will prevent operators from dumping soil in green belts, help preserve roads, reduce disruptions normally caused by excavation, ensure faster work and also help in curtailing air pollution, an especially critical factor during the upcoming winter months.According to officials, the matter had come up for discussion during a meeting of GMDA's core planning cell (CPC) last month, following which the CPC had directed that trenchless machines be used for laying utilities. The chief engineers of infrastructure 1 and 2 divisions were also directed to draft a ""policy decision"" for the use of trenchless machines so that open digging may be restricted.""As of now, utilities are mostly being laid through open digging, which means excavating the portion. 
For example, in case of a road, one person digs up the road, then another comes and does some other work, then a third again digs it up for another reason. Such things weaken the road, which is continuously broken and relaid. The aim of using trenchless machines is to prevent this from happening. It will help maintain roads, green belts and other GMDA assets,"" said a senior GMDA official.""Once this policy is adopted, it will be mandatory for any operator carrying out work in the right of way (ROW) of GMDA to use trenchless machines instead of indulging in open digging. Around 95% of infrastructural work is possible through this method. If there are instances where work cannot be done through this means and open digging is required, the requirement will be assessed on a case-to-case basis by the authority. A policy decision is being worked upon,"" the official said.At the CPC meeting last month, the GMDA chief executive officer had also directed the chief engineers to ensure that a ground penetrating radar survey is done by every applicant applying for work within ROW of GMDA, and the applicant submits an as-built drawing after execution of the work. While the GPR survey shows the placement of utilities in terms of both location and depth prior to construction, as-built drawings depict the area where the work was undertaken after it is completed.The GMDA chief had also directed that officials should ensure that a bank guarantee for the work is obtained and it is sufficient to ensure that the applicant uses trenchless machines to complete the work.GMDA has been working on several plans to make the process of laying and maintaining utilities in the city smoother and faster, including procuring a GPR machine of its own and mapping all utilities laid down by different agencies and making the data available to the public on the OneMap portal.

Diwali firecrackers: HSI issues 'sound' advice for pet owners,The Times of India (TOI),11-03-2021,CHENNAI,"CHENNAI: This year, with the number of Covid-19 cases coming down, people are looking forward to celebrating Diwali with more fervour, hoping that the festival of lights will usher in a bright future after the gloom and doom of the pandemic. But even as people shop for clothes and sweets, cracker stalls are also doing brisk business. Unfortunately, even as people celebrate, animals and birds get injured and sick, with the rise in air and noise pollution. Many pets also run away from home and end up on the streets and in animal shelters. 
That's why animal lovers and NGOs are requesting people to celebrate a noise-free, animal friendly Diwali.""Diwali is a vibrant time for people but can often lead to extreme stress and discomfort for pets and street animals. We urge everyone to celebrate the festival of lights as it is meant to be celebrated - with lamps, lights, sweets and delicious savouries and not loud firecrackers. This year, more than ever, we must consider the safety and wellness of others including the old, the young and the animals who are all sensitive to noise pollution. We also request our citizens to follow Covid-19 precautions and guidelines issued by the government,"" says Alokparna Sengupta, managing director of HSI/ India.The organisation has also put out some 'sound' advice for citizens who want to help animals around them:~ Keep your pets indoors and in a familiar room. Pets have a heightened sense of hearing, so jolts and loud noises cause many animals to flee in search of a safe haven. Leave on calming music or the television, if possible.~ Keep all doors and windows closed and draw the curtains to reduce the noise. Supply pets with enough food and water and ensure someone can stay with them to comfort them.~ Urge people to avoid igniting loud firecrackers and instead use firecrackers that emit less smoke and do not create much noise.~ Store fireworks safely in a closed box, somewhere cool and dry, and out of reach of pets. Do not keep firework containers under stairs or exposed in passages.~ Decorate with lights, lamps and diyas that are friendlier to the environment and animals (i.e., ones that give off less smoke and noise.)~ Refrain from setting firecrackers off near an animal shelter or zoo. The loud explosion can cause panic and fear. Pollution from burning firecrackers is harmful to their health.~ Take dogs for a walk during the daytime before the celebrations begin. Never walk them near where others are lighting firecrackers.~ Consult a veterinarian if your pets are prone to acute anxiety or distress from loud noises and give anti-anxiety medicines, if necessary and only through a vet's prescription. Check their availability during Diwali, ahead of time, in case of an emergency.~ Ensure pets are wearing collars and identification tags with current contact information. All pets, even those kept indoors, should always wear collars with identification tags.~ If you feed street animals around your neighbourhood, make sure they are wearing tags labelled with their names and your phone numbers. Provide them shelter in an area where they may be safe from the firecrackers and the noise.~ Make a first-aid kit in preparation for helping injured animals. Have a bucket full of water handy for an emergency and to place used sparklers inside.~ Keep contact information for local municipal corporations and surrounding shelters handy and approach them immediately in case of lost pets. If you find lost pets, either take them to the address on the tag or a local animal shelter. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"AQI 'poor' for 3 days, health dept says stay indoors",The Times of India (TOI),11-02-2021,GURGAON,"Gurgaon: First Covid, now bad air. The health department has asked Gurgaon residents to avoid stepping out of homes unless absolutely necessary as the city's air quality has remained in the ""poor"" category for three days on the trot.Should people have to step out urgently, they should wear masks all the time and consult a doctor in case of breathing problems, giddiness, chest discomfort, cough and irritation in the eyes. The department has also asked people to avoid areas that witness heavy trafficOn Sunday, Gurgaon recorded an AQI of 262. An AQI in the 201 to 300 range is considered ""poor"" while that between 301 and 400 is ""very poor"". Officials fear the air quality may turn worse in the coming week. 
According to the Central Pollution Control Board, air quality in the ""poor"" range can cause breathing discomfort in case of prolonged exposure and even respiratory illnesses. Officials said children should be made to wear air filter masks in case they step out of homes. ""People with airway, lungs or heart illnesses should have medicines available with them. They should avoid going for morning and evening walks. Doors and windows should be kept closed in the mornings and evenings,"" said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer.He also stressed that people should not burst crackers, even in areas where they would be allowed during the festivals. ""Harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide are emitted when you burn crackers. These gases affect the ozone layer. Since the particulate matter's size is 2.5, they easily enter our body through the nasal vessels and settle into our lungs. At times, PM 2.5 gets absorbed into our blood vessels as well. These have an effect on the respiratory system. This is why people should avoid outdoor activities during peak pollution hours,"" Yadav added.Doctors backed the health department advisory. ""As the winter settles, the air quality is slowly becoming poor. There is a rise in the number of respiratory cases such as viral pneumonia, asthma and COPD. Such patients have difficulty breathing, cough, fever, increased sputum and sleep disturbances. Such people should wear masks, continue preventive therapies and consider vaccinations for flu and pneumonia after consulting a doctor,"" said Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital.

Lucknow: Saturday 2nd most polluted day of November,The Times of India (TOI),11/29/2021,LUCKNOW,"LUCKNOW: The city witnessed a spike in pollution levels by around 150 units in the last five days, with the air quality deteriorating from poor to 'very poor' on Saturday.According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city's Air Quality Index was 317. As compared to Friday, the air pollution level registered an increase of over 32 units in just 24 hours making the weekend, the second most air polluted day of the month.
Track the pollution level in your cityA high concentration of nano pollutants of PM2.5 and PM10 was registered in all main localities of the city, including Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Indiranagar, Nishatganj, Kukrail, Gomtinagar and Talkatora, where the average concentration in morning and evening hours crossed an alarming 350-mark. Environmentalists said the spike in air pollution level is majorly due to a drop in temperatures, an increase in vehicular load due to rush in markets following the wedding season and low wind speed.According to CPCB live air quality monitoring station, PM 2.5 concentrations were found to be around six times higher than the permissible limit of 60 and PM 10 concentrations were found to be around four times higher than the permissible limits set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The last time the air pollution levels of the city crossed the 300-mark was on November 8, when air pollution level was 338 and on November 1 when AQI was 308.""Entire November has been in the grip of poor air quality. The situation is expected to worsen in December and January due to further drop in temperatures.

Transport dept to map out routes for public vehicles in Bihar,The Times of India (TOI),11-08-2021,PATNA,"PATNA: Following the concept of vehicle carrying capacity of road, the state transport department will map out the routes for public vehicles like autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and buses for faster mobility as well as to free up choked roads and improve the air quality. It will be initially implemented in Patna and neighbouring areas like Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwarisharif. The department is developing a software to help decide the routes for public vehicles through geographic information system (GIS). Transport officials have started the manual survey for urban public transport route planning, which includes the number of public vehicles, routes on which the vehicles are plying, travel demand pattern and exploring new routes.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the number of public vehicles has been increasing in the state capital, causing huge traffic congestion on several routes and rise in air pollution. 
""To regulate the volume of traffic and rush on several roads, the department will chalk out the routes for autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and even buses, based on the survey report. We will hold a meeting with all the stakeholders, including public transport associations and ward councillors to check the requirement of public vehicles,"" he said.Agarwal said there are surplus autorickshaws on some routes like Patna Junction and Gandhi Maidan while huge deficit in public transport services persists in some areas. ""As per the number of public vehicles, we will plan the routes for autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and buses and how many vehicles will be run on each route will depend on the vehicle carrying capacity of the road,"" he said.""The department will issue permit to new vehicles with routes mentioned while the old vehicles will be streamlined. Once this is implemented, all details regarding autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and buses, including the contact number and name of the drivers, will be available at a click. It will also help in tracking a vehicle in case of any emergency situation,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

70 new stations to monitor air quality,The Times of India (TOI),12/30/2021,KOLKATA,"Kolkata: Seventy sensor-based air and noise quality monitoring stations went live in Kolkata and rest of the state on Tuesday morning. Eighty more stations are likely to come up soon.WBPCB is setting up a Central Command Centre at its headquarters, where its team of scientists and analysts will study the data round the clock in real time to come up with comprehensive, actionable data for short- and long-term mitigation measures. Operated by West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), these stations will provide real-time air and noise data, along with a couple of meteorological details, to make the network robust and intensive in the country. 
The sensor based monitoring will include PM1 (ultra-fine particulate matter), which will be used for research, as Central Pollution Control Board has not yet included PM1 monitoring in its mandate.These 70 stations are part of the ambitious '150 station project' that WBPCB has taken up. Once the entire project is ready, it will be a network of 243 stations, including its 79 manual and 14 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS). ""National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked us to monitor the air quality of all seven non-attainment cities Barrackpore, Haldia, Durgapur, Asansol, Ranigunj, Kolkata and Howrah. Apart from complying with the NGT order, we have extended the monitoring network, particularly along the border of the state. A recent study of IIT-Delhi showed 53% of the city's pollution is contributed by trans-border pollution, 21% of it from Bangladesh. A massive amount of this pollution constitutes dust caused by erosion of farmland top soil,"" said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra.During winter, he said, pollutants of the Indo-Gangetic Plain travelled easily to Kolkata, situated at the tail end of the plain. This is why the air quality monitoring along the borders helped us understand the dynamism of air pollution and underlined the requirement of a regional approach for its mitigation measures, he said.Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra said, ""Climate change is no more a possibility of the future but is already at play at our doorsteps. We are getting affected by the delayed onset of seasons and longer inundation because of erratic monsoon. Police have a major role to play in containing social unrest induced by climate change. We have started making our force aware of the dangers of air pollution, noise pollution, climate changes, plastic waste and absence of waste segregation. We are trying to turn our academic campuses green and minimize waste generation by adopting segregation of wastes and composting.""WBPCB member secretary Roshni Sen said, ""Air quality affects us all. We can't escape it by confining ourselves to our home as several studies have hinted that indoor air is often worse than ambient air. We all need to work in unison to improve the air quality.""

Sharing a data of National Family Health Survey-5, Singh said 15% of the state population was consuming liquor, while in Maharashtra, the percentage was less than in Bihar. ""This is the mockery of prohibition. It is a shame that liquor bottles have been recovered from the premises of Vidhan Sabha,"" he said.JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar asked Singh to tell who had informed them about the empty bottles. ""After getting the information, did you call on the toll-free number or the number released by KK Pathak? You did not fulfil your responsibility,"" said Neeraj. Without naming anyone, he said an RJD leader's son was found in a drunken state, but the party has taken no action yet.Singh then reminded Neeraj of liquor bottles seized from a school run by the brother of a cabinet minister.Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra raised the issue of increase in crime in Madhubani district and mentioned several incidents, including assault on a judge in Jhankharpur by the cops, murder of scribe Avinash Jha, who had exposed the fake hospitals and dead body of a girl Gulshan recovered from officer's colony in Madhubani. MLC Sanjeev Shyam Singh raised the issue of increase in air pollution in different towns of Bihar. BJP MLC Sanjay Prakash alias Sanjay Mayukh backed Singh and asked the government to take this issue seriously. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

How Indian coir became a money-spinner for China,The Times of India (TOI),1/20/2022,TOP STORIES,"For many, Pollachi in Tamil Nadu may bring to mind tall coconut trees and mounds of coconut husks being dried in large plots of land. One of the largest producers of coconut in the country, the district is yet to reap the full benefits of this resource.While the coir industry is growing at a rate of 10-15% every year, there has been a negative growth in the value of coir because of negligible attempts to make value-added products despite the availability of raw coir in abundance. So, while globally there is a demand for coir wood, geotextiles, mattresses and mattings, Pollachi units are stuck on making coir pith and exporting raw coir fibre.The potential of coconut fibre or coir, which comprises 60% of the husk, largely remains untapped, says industry insiders. A recent announcement by the Tamil Nadu government on establishing a coir processing cluster in Pollachi is considered a step towards realising its potential, but there is a long way to go.The district has about 600 coir mills that defibre coconuts and export the raw coir fibre to China after extracting coco pith. 
Instead, the coir can be converted into yarn, mattress, floor mats and doormats.""Data reveals that of the 9 lakh tonnes of coir produced in the country, nearly 7.5 lakh tonnes are exported to China, and a similar trend is witnessed in Pollachi,"" said SK Gowthaman, a member of the Coir Board.The product most Pollachi units focus on at present is coir pith and its ancillary products, which is a change from the 1990s, when coir processing units started coming up. The units were primarily engaged in extracting the coir fibre out of coconut husk and sending it to Kerala to be converted into value-added products such as mattresses and other material. Coco pith had no value then and was burned on the roadsides.The trend reversed in the next 20 years when coco pith's water retaining capacity made it popular as an alternative to soil. In 2015, coco pith was such a big hit in agriculture and gardening that the coir industry in Pollachi was running with its profits.""The cost of coco pith, which was ?2.5 a kg in the early 2000s, has now increased to ?25 a kg. But the value of coir didn't grow as it was just exported as a raw material to China,"" said Gowthaman.About a decade ago, when China entered the Indian market for importing coir fibre to make value-added products such as mattresses, Pollachi became its sourcing centre. Over the years, the dependence on the Chinese markets has increased to such an extent that Pollachi units suffer when China stops importing coir for about three weeks during their new year at the end of January every year.While globally, there has been a demand for value-added coir fibre products, most units in Pollachi haven't been able to catch on to that trend.""In the early 2000s, the rate of export of coir to China was ?500-700 for 30kg, now it has been ?250-350 for the past four years. This is because products and not raw coir bring in the revenue,"" said Gowthaman.S Mahesh Kumar of the Federation of Indian Coir Exporters Association (FICEA) said he has stopped exporting coir fibre to China. ""People are starting to move to natural fibre, which is a positive sign for the coir industry,"" he said. He has started producing value-added products such as bags, slippers and mattresses that are in demand in the international and domestic markets.B Karthigaivasan, general manager, district industries centre (DIC), said the coir processing cluster announced by the state government is a move towards addressing the gap in the industry and the market. About 35 entrepreneurs in the coir industry have formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for establishing the cluster. The cluster will be formed at a cost of ?23.7 crore, of which the Centre will spend ?12 crore, the state ?2 crore and rest will be borne by the SPV.The cluster will have four machineries, which include coir quilting machine, coir needle punch machine, coir sheet production with latex spray and coir tufted mats with latex. Besides this, a laboratory for coir testing will also be part of the cluster, he said.The new prospects, however, need to be eco-friendly as well as the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has enforced stricter pollution control norms for coir pith units. P Manimaran, Coimbatore district environment engineer at TNPCB, stressed on the need for coir processing units to upgrade their facilities as per the present pollution control norms.""The problem arises in the conventional process wherein the husk is piled up in agricultural land and sprayed with water for extraction of coir and coco pith. This leads to contamination of groundwater. When it is left to dry in the field, the coco pith particles are suspended, resulting in air pollution. There is advanced machinery available that can segregate the husk with minimal effluent discharge,"" said Manimaran. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"IIT-Delhi startup launches ""world's smallest"" wearable air purifier, Naso95",The Times of India (TOI),2/25/2022,GADGETS NEWS,"IIT-Delhi start-up Nanoclean Global has launched the ""world's smallest"" wearable air purifier, Naso95. Nanoclean Global claims that Naso95 is at par effective to an N95 grade face mask. The launch ceremony at IIT Delhi observed gathering from Doctors and Government officials. 
Shri. Rajesh Kumar Pathak, IP & TAFS cadre, Secretary Technology Development Board, Gov. of India was the chief guest and Dr M C Mishra, Ex Director AIIMS, Delhi was guest of honour. What is Naso95 and how it works Naso95 is an N95 grade nasal filter. It sticks to the user's nasal orifice and prevents bacteria, viral infection and pollen and air pollution. It is at par effective with an N95 grade face mask.According to the company, a person wearing Naso95 is more protected than a generic facemask or a loosely fitted face mask. The product is said to have been tested and certified by national and international labs for its safety and efficiency. Naso95 comes in different sizes: Small, Medium, Large and Kids size.The product Naso95 can also be used by kids prone to air borne infections and air pollution. Dr M C Mishra, ex-director, AIIMS-Delhi, said that air pollution is a much bigger problem than viruses. Lung cancer remains the leading form of cancer and a product like Naso95 can effectively address the problem of respiratory illnesses in metro cities. During the pandemic, the product can specially come in handy at places where one has to pull down a mask for the purpose of identification for e.g. airports, security checks etc. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Protect bus priority lane on ORR: NGO,The Times of India (TOI),3/28/2022,BENGALURU,"Times News Network
Bengaluru: With bollards for the bus priority lane on Outer Ring Road (ORR) likely to be removed, Greenpeace India on Saturday demanded protection and expansion of BMTC lanes across the city. 
Its members painted messages such as 'protect the bus lane' on ORR. ""Bengaluru has been experiencing very critical air quality for the past many years. Greenpeace India's recent report found the annual average of PM2.5 and PM10 exceed WHO's revised standards in the city. Previous source apportionment studies identified the transportation sector as one of the major sources of air pollution in the city,"" the NGO said in a statement. 
""Like in many other Indian cities, public transport in Bengaluru caters to majority of citizens and the bus priority lane particularly has reduced travel time, improved predictability, increased service supply along the corridor, and resulted in improved bus ridership and revenue. In fact, BMTC which comprises just 0.15% of the total vehicle population, helps 50% of the human population in the city access mobility,"" it said. 
The organisation also suggested that companies must encourage employees to adopt public transport while implementing flexible hybrid work policies. Campaign manager Avinash Chanchal said it is unfortunate that representatives of companies have been asking the government to reconsider the bus lane instead of urging it to strengthen public transport.

"Uttarakhand HC notes DU student's letter, asks why Oak leaves burnt",The Times of India (TOI),04-08-2022,DEHRADUN,"NAINITAL: Taking suo motu cognisance of a letter seeking a ban on open burning of Oak leaves in Nainital by Medha Pandey, a fifth-semester LLB student at Delhi University (DU), the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday asked why the leaves shed by trees in forests of Nainital were being burnt by sanitation workers, adding to air pollution in the lake town, when they can be turned into manure instead. Pandey also pointed out that open burning of waste is prohibited by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) across the country. A division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Kumar Mishra and Justice RC Khulbe sent notices in this regard to the Union ministry of environment, forest & climate change (MoEF&CC), the Uttarakhand government, district magistrate of Nainital and nagar palika parishad, Nainital. 
The respondents have been asked to submit their replies within four weeks. Pandey, a resident of Nainital, had written the letter to the chief justice of HC on March 23. In the letter, she pointed out that ""Nainital is surrounded by oak forests and the dried leaves keep falling on roads, streets and roofs."" ""Local residents and sanitation workers burn them, which affects the health of the environment as well as that of residents,"" the letter said, adding that oak leaves can be put to good use if turned into manure. ""The leaves can also be deposited on forest floors, where they would retain the ground's moisture and shelter insects and snakes. Moreover, it is noticed that burning of dry leaves adjacent to forest areas can sometimes result in fire spreading to the forested area, leading to widespread forest fires,"" Pandey wrote in the letter, adding that ""imposing a ban on burning of leaves will help increase water retention capacity in the forests of Nainital"".

"Green fuel push: West Bengal offers registration fee immunity, tax breather for CNG, e-vehicles",The Times of India (TOI),5/29/2022,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: In a bid to encourage and fast-track adoption of vehicles powered by green fuel, the state government on Friday announced exemption of registration fees and that of road tax for two years on electric two-wheelers and cars and all categories of CNG vehicles.Adoption of vehicles with cleaner fuel will pave the way for a better environment as petrol and diesel-powered vehicles contribute to 30% of the city's ambient air pollution. While there is no emission in electric vehicles, CNG burns cleaner than petrol and diesel and emits 80% less carbon monoxide and 44% less hydrocarbons. CNG cars also run quieter than gasoline and diesel vehicles.This one-time exemption of registration fees, tax, and additional tax would be effective from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2024, stated the order issued by transport principal secretary Rajesh Kumar Sinha. 
According to the order, vehicles registered on or after April 1, 2022, till date of issuance of this notification, may get an extension of tax validity for the exact number of days for which tax has already been paid that falls within the period from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024. However, adjustment or refund of registration fees, if already paid, is disallowed. Electric vehicle manufacturers and environmentalists have been urging the state government to incentivise purchase of green-fuel vehicles that are more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines that run on petrol or diesel. Earlier, in the 2022-23 budget statement, minister of state for finance Chandrima Bhattacharya had announced a one-time exemption of tax and additional tax on battery-operated e-vehicles and on all categories of CNG-operated vehicles for the same period.

Haryana to get its first 3 real-time noise monitoring stations - all in Faridabad,The Times of India (TOI),06-01-2022,FARIDABAD,"GURUGRAM : In the wake of growing concerns over noise levels breaching permissible limits, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) plans to set up the state's first three real-time noise level monitoring stations in Faridabad. Equipped with digital display boards and connected to a centralised networking system, these stations will monitor noise levels continuously for 24 hours and around the year.Tenders inviting bids are out, and the board will award the work by mid-June. Faridabad is likely to get the three stations by August-end. 
According to HSPCB, these stations will help formulate an action plan for curbing noise pollution in the coming days. ""We have opened the bidding for the project. June 6 is the last date for bids in response to the tender document for three real-time monitoring stations in Faridabad,"" HSPCB member secretary S Narayan told TOI.The HSPCB already has real-time ambient air quality monitoring stations at sectors 16A, 11, 30 and a new industrial area in Faridabad. The noise monitoring stations are likely to come up at three of these locations, but the pollution board is yet to take a final call.The values of various parameters measured in the noise monitoring stations shall be transferred online automatically and stored in the central server networking system, just like the air quality index data.The board has taken this initiative out of concerns over the increasing use of automobiles in the region, a primary cause of noise pollution. While noise pollution does not receive as much attention as air and water pollution, it impacts our health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 1.1 billion young people aged between 12-35 years are at risk of hearing loss due to noise exposure.Faridabad is the only Haryana district on the non-attainment cities' list of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which means its air did not meet the national ambient air quality standards from 2011 to 15. So, it will be the first district to get the noise monitoring stations because the long-term plan is to ensure that, along with air pollution, noise pollution gets monitored for further analysis and creating a road map to curb the problems together.According to the noise standards for ambient air and automobiles, domestic appliances and construction equipment, notified in Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, the limit is 55 decibels (dB) in residential areas, 65 dB in commercial areas, and 75 dB in industrial areas. Near sensitive areas such as hospitals, noise levels should not exceed 45 dB. At night, the limit is 45 dB in residential areas, 55dB in commercial areas, and 70 dB in industrial areas.""This new project will help our department prepare a database, identify the dangerous sources of noise pollution and take adequate action,"" said an HSPCB officer. The plan is to expand the project to Gurugram , as well. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

New air regime: How MCD plans to tackle C&D waste,The Times of India (TOI),7/19/2022,DELHI,"New Delhi: In its new policy on air pollution, the Commission for Air Quality Management has directed Delhi government's urban department and the urban local bodies to register all construction and demolition projects involving over 500 square metres on their web portals by August 30.Municipal Corporation of Delhi officials claimed to be verifying and monitoring construction sites and submitting details on a web portal developed by Delhi government. ""CAQM's norms basically apply to big constructions and public works. MCD needs to give a self-declaration about the arrangements for clearing construction and demolition waste on the state government portal,"" said an MCD official.The official added, ""We were taking the help of the building department to get details of ongoing construction and the works department for other development projects in areas under our jurisdiction. 
But during the unification of the municipal corporations, the process slowed down. Now we will again take appropriate measures in a time-bound manner.""On July 9, Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai announced a special campaign on self-registration of constructions on sites larger than 500sqm from July 15 to 30. The self-assessment portal was launched in October last year. The minister said, ""As it is difficult to visit all construction and demolition sites, the project proponents have to compulsorily register on the portal and upload the self-declaration form on a fortnightly basis. Delhi Pollution Control Committee has been authorised to take action against defaulters.""The CAQM policy instructs the local bodies to ensure segregation of C&D waste at the site and transport it to notified collection centres and processing plants. At present, the city generates 6,000-7,000 tonne of C&D waste per day. There are four C&D waste processing units capable of handling 4,150 TPD. Three others with a total capacity of 2,500 TPD are proposed at Ranikhera, Tehkhand and Libaspur by March 2023.The new pollution policy stresses on expansion of waste recycling capabilities, material recovery centres and timely completion of ongoing and planned infrastructure works. ""We have 152 material recovery centres dealing with 228 TPD of waste. About 275 TPD are processed at the local level,"" said an MCD official.Officials claimed that in the next two years, they will be able to incinerate at least 8,000 tonnes of 11,000 tonnes of municipal waste at new waste-to-energy plants. ""We are in the process of calling for bids for the proposed WTE plant at Bawana, while the one at Tehkhand will become operational by September end,"" added the official.

LG: Dust from unpaved roads major factor in air pollution,The Times of India (TOI),08-01-2022,DELHI,"New Delhi: Lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Saturday appreciated the new graded response action plan put forward by the Centre's air quality panel and instructed all the implementing agencies to work in coordination to tackle Delhi's air pollution.At a meeting held with the members of the panel and agencies, the LG pointed out that 26% of the air pollution is generated from the dust due to unpaved roads and central verges. He asked the officials concerned to cover, repair, or carpet the roads and central verges within fixed deadlines. 
He also directed the officials to discard the ""self-defeating prevalent practice"" of laying interlocking blocks on reinforced cement concrete and rather opt for interlocking blocks by compaction, which will allow water to seep down and reduce cost of construction.He stressed that measures to control air pollution from vehicular emission, road and C&D dust, burning of solid municipal and agro waste and industrial emissions should be taken without any delay.The LG claimed that the total length of dust-generating, non-paved and open roadsides belonging to the PWD and municipal corporation was 165 km and 59.7 km, respectively.Saxena asked the air panel members to explore the possibility of installing rotating mist sprinklers on highrise buildings. He asked the environment department to immediately provide funds to the corporation for purchase of mechanised sweeping machines. ""He also asked for fixed separate colour codes to be adopted by different road-owning agencies so as to make the ownership and responsibility related to it, easily identifiable,"" said a statement from the LG office.

PWD to install kerbside EV charging points across Delhi: Explained,The Times of India (TOI),9/27/2022,AUTO-NEWS,"The Delhi government had recently announced plans to set up kerbside electric vehicle (EV) charging points across the city. Public Works Department (PWD) has now picked 20 road stretches for installation of these EV chargers as a part of the pilot project, while 55 roads in North-East and North-West districts have been deemed not feasible for the project so far.One of the main factors that decides the feasibility of the location is street parking capacity for EVs to stop and charge without affecting road usage. 
More areas are expected to be identified for the roll out of the project. That said, eight nodal officers have been appointed to coordinate among Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC), transport department and PWD on the project.Delhi government feels that kerbside charging is an emerging concept globally and that street lamp posts or dedicated charging points can be used for charging vehicles. PWD has approximately 1,400 km of roads under its jurisdiction, with one lakh lamp posts. The state government plans to put up 5,000 kerbside charging points across the capital over the next three years.The pilot project will aim at 100 kerbside chargers serviced equally by the power distribution companies like Delhi Transco Limited, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited, BSES Yamuna Power Limited and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. Once EV chargers are installed on all major roads following the pilot, the deployment will be scaled across the city. The government is largely targeting electric two-wheeler and three-wheelers since they occupy less space on the road, but reportedly cause more air pollution than most of other vehicles.

Paddy stubble: Relief sought for farmers,The Times of India (TOI),9/26/2022,CHANDIGARH,"Chandigarh: Asking the central government to compensate the farmers for managing crop stubble, Punjab environment minister Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the state had given away 90,422 subsidised CRM (crop residue management) machines and would give away 32,100 more.
Speaking at the national conference of the state environment ministers, Hayer said Punjab was ready to contribute its share if the central government was ready to match it. The minister said: ""The air pollution caused by stubble burning troubles not only Punjab but the entire country. Punjab brought the country out of food crisis and now, in its hour of need, the Centre should hold its hand. We are in a large-scale awareness campaign for the farmers and also reaching them out through university students.""
The minister claimed that out of the second lot of 32,100 CRM machines to be given away, the state government had sanctioned 21,000. Also, the subsidy was 50% for individual farmers and 80% for panchayats or farming societies. Paddy straw is being used as fuel for electricity and biogas plants, Hayer claimed, adding this will make crop residuce a source of income for the farmers. tnn

"Bhopal coughs the morning after, AQI shoots to 264",The Times of India (TOI),10/27/2022,BHOPAL,"Bhopal: Air quality across major cities of Madhya Pradesh was not fit to breathe on prolonged exposure due to Diwali fireworks. The air quality was not only poor, but was actually worse than the previous year, pointing out that people burst more fireworks this year as if to make up for the past two pandemic years. 
Due to bursting of crackers till late in the night, pollution levels go up the next morning after Diwali. On Tuesday, the air quality index in major MP cities including Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur was rated poor by the central pollution control board and there was an increase of close to 20 points in the air quality index when compared to last year's morning after the Diwali night. 
Among the main cities, air quality of Gwalior was the worst followed by Bhopal, Jabalpur and Indore. The difference in the air quality index of the four cities was not huge, but the air quality index of all four cities ranged between 200 and 300, which is poor and may lead to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.
The air quality index of Gwalior was 274, Bhopal 264, Jabalpur 223 and Indore was 209. It means the air pollution levels were lowest in Indore.
But when compared to last year, Jabalpur was the only city where pollution levels marginally went down this Diwali. The air quality index last year after the Diwali night was 260 in Gwalior, 244 of Bhopal, 197 of Indore and 244 of Jabalpur. It means pollution levels marginally went down in Jabalpur this year, though it continues to remain in the poor category.
There was no real attempt to enforce the cracker bursting schedule or to promote sale of green crackers.
Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure.

"'Netas must go around coal-hit villages, see damage for themselves'",The Times of India (TOI),10/24/2022,NAGPUR,"Leena Buddhe, who runs the Centre for Sustainable Development, has been taking up many issues related to farmers' sufferings due to coal pollution. Thanks to her, problems being faced by villages when it comes to pollution from coal-fired power plants and a coal washery in Nagpur district, has got state attention. Earlier this year, she brought in the then environment minister Aditya Thackeray to understand the problems of the villagers.TOI speaks to Buddhe on her findings, the rising catastrophes due to coal and the neglectful attitude of government agencies.Excerpts from an interview...Q. You have been working since a long time in the social sector. When did coal pollution catch your eye?
A. This was actually during the Covid pandemic when I was attending an online workshop organized by Pune-based research centre Manthan Adhyayan Kendra. Its founder Shripad Dharmadikari was giving a presentation on the severe pollution happening in our region due to coal-fired power plants. It then hit me that when experts from other cities are talking about it, we being a local organization should pay serious heed to it. Our fight against coal pollution started with curiosity but after six months of deep research and on-ground survey, we realized how grave the problem is.Q. What were your initial findings?A. We started by visiting villages that were impacted and building a rapport with the sarpanchs and locals. The first village we visited was Chakki Khapa which was almost 9 km from Koradi Thermal Power Plant. We were completely taken aback when we saw that the crops were all covered in coal dust. The farmers have been losing 30-40% of their agricultural yield because of this; health impacts aside. The fact that these plants are in existence for 2-3 decades and still nobody was raising their voice against pollution was quite surprising.Q. Why were the locals tight-lipped about it?A. The reason why these issues were not being highlighted was that there was no collective voice coming out from the villages. The power plant authorities would manipulate the villagers by telling them how they have given the latter jobs and electricity. What the locals didn't realize was that it was coming at the cost of their lives. When we interacted with the women self-help groups, we could sense that they are aware of all the impacts of pollution but don't complain as they fear that men would lose their jobs. Farmers would get job at the power plants in exchange of their agricultural fields.Q. How bad is the situation on ground? In what ways is pollution from power plants affecting public health and environment?A. It is much worse than we think it is. Do you know why one of the most impacted Khasala village is called New Khasala? Because the entire village was shifted from its original location to where it is now so that the power plant could discharge toxic fly-ash. Most of the villagers got a job at the plant and, today, there are hardly any farmers left. Not only has this taken them away from their roots but also exposed them to major public health threat. Even though the plant officials claim that the discharge is reused, majority of it finds its way to agricultural fields, nullahs and rivers which are major drinking water sources. And the massive air pollution that they are exposed too is another problem altogether.Q. The Khasala ash bund recently saw a major breach which submerged nearby villages and led to enormous losses. Do you think the catastrophes arising from coal plants have now increased?A. The reason why such mishaps are increasing is because the ash bunds of Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants are full to its brim as they have failed miserably in ensuring the mandatory utilization of fly-ash. Instead of clearing up their old bunds, they keep on acquiring agricultural lands and building new ones. And the worst part is that the regulatory bodies are not bothered. When a power plant writes on paper that they have used certain amount of fly-ash, what mechanism does the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has to verify it? In our surveillance meetings, Mahagenco claims that they submit all pollution data to MPCB. My question is that why is this data not made public? Doesn't a sarpanch of a village has the right to know what kind of air they are breathing?Q. Do you feel that the regulatory bodies and the power generation company are hand-in-glove?A. From our interactions, one thing that is certainly clear is that the major problem is both being government bodies. When the Khasala ash bund breach happened, our question to MPCB was that whether they would have been this lenient had it been a private power plant. Just because these plants are state-owned, it doesn't give them the right to pollute. MPCB can prosecute the officials, file criminal complaints but it's not using its power for reasons best known to them. Are they hand-in-glove then? May be.Q. What role do politicians play in such a crisis?A. Politicians can play a major role. The whole situation depends on the sensitivity and understanding of the person in power. And we have seen some wonderful examples. Like when former state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray stopped discharge of fly-ash in Nandgaon. He could gauge and understand the damage it was doing. Politicians should go around villages, interact with the locals. They need to decide why they have come to power, for people or the coal industry?Q. It is absolutely impossible that Mahagenco is unaware of the damage it is doing. Still, it seems to be always on denial.A. Of course, the company is aware. Its website states that Mahagenco's vision is to take care of project-impacted people. But, in reality, it lacks sensitivity towards the locals. And when the power units buy them with jobs, people are scared to raise their voices. Villagers are not aware of their rights; their right to breathe clean air, drink clean water. And in many cases, people are scared to oppose such a powerful agency. This is why we have been focusing on mobilising and empowering locals. In one of our committee meetings, a sarpanch told Mahagenco officials, ""aapne humare ghar ke saamne 314 acre mein raakh rakhi hai. Mai aapke ghar ke saamne do trucks bhar ke raakh rakh deta hun. Aap fir mujhe batana kaisa lagta hai"". For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Chennai choked on toxic smoke on Diwali: Data,The Times of India (TOI),10/27/2022,CHENNAI,"CHENNAI: Air pollution was severe in Chennai on Diwali, with Sowcarpet recording an AQI of 786, followed by Nungambakkam at 565, Valasaravakkam 545, Triplicane 503 and Thiruvotriyur 436. AQI in the 50-100 range is considered safe. Noise pollution too was high between 66 and 79.7 decibels. The normal is 65 decibels during daytime and 55 decibels at night.Cracker buffs celebrated Diwali with such vengeance this year, that Chennai overtook Delhi as the nation's most polluted city for two consecutive days. 
Chennai's air pollution was the highest in a decade.The air quality index of Chennai used to be in 50-100 range on a normal day when factories, thermal stations and vehicular pollution exist. On Monday, however, it shot up to maximum of 786 in Sowcarpet. At 345, Besant Nagar recorded the least. T Nagar recorded 372, while Triplicane at 503, Nungambakkam 565, Valasaravakkam 545 and Thiruvotriyur 436 also sizzled. Last year, the AQI on Diwali day ranged between 342 and 385. And noise pollution ranged between 66 and 79.7 decibels. Given the fact that 22 micrograms per metre cube of PM2.5 is equivalent to smoking one cigarette, a Chennaiite and pups have inhaled particulate matter equal to 31 cigarettes when PM2.5 was in 690-700 range. As per central pollution control board norms, AQI of 0-50 is considered good and 50-100 is satisfactory. Anything above 400 is severe. G Sundararajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal said the AQI which used to be in the range of 50-100 spiking beyond 700 on Diwali showed that crackers were one of the major polluters. ""We request the state government to take a decision and implement a complete ban on crackers like the Delhi government,"" he said. It was not just the air pollution and noise pollution that were high. Even cracker waste went up by 70 tonnes compared to last year, as per Chennai corporation data, indicating that cracker indeed was the villain. At night, the TNPCB realtime monitoring stations showed PM levels of 950 ug/ m3 between 11pm and 12am in some locations which is disastrous for health. The TNPCB, however, claimed weather conditions also played a role. ""This is due to large number of people bursting fi recrackers (mainly night crackers and sky shots) and high relative humidity and low wind speed. The climatic condition is not conducive for the effective dispersion of the smoke emanated from the bursting of crackers,"" the TNPCB statement read. The board had set up seven temporary monitoring stations for 15 days and monitored the pre-Diwali and post-Diwali levels of the air quality index For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Shamli directs farmers to send stubble to cow shelters,The Times of India (TOI),10/13/2022,DEHRADUN,"SHAMLI: As stubble burning is a primary factor for heavy air pollution in the Delhi and NCR region, the Shamli district administration is using a strict approach to prevent it. Besides, provision of free 15,000 bottles of bio-decomposers, farmers are advised to donate the bio waste after paddy harvest to cow shelters. ""We have set a target to receive 600 tons of stubble waste to be deposited at cow shelters in the district and various methods of residue management are being taught to farmers through seminars,"" said DM Shamli Jasjeet Kaur. The district administration has warned that if any incident of stubble farming is found, FIR will be filed against the farmer and village Pradhan. Farmer leader Kapil Khatian told TOI, ""We are facing the problem of fodder as crops have been affected due to late rain, straw has also decreased due to low yield of wheat. Thus, farmers will also use the leftover stubble as fodder. The government should take care of Delhi-NCR garbage dumps, prevent them from fire."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Air pollution worsening underlying diseases, it's a silent killer: Guleria",The Times of India (TOI),11-10-2022,DELHI,"As Delhi breathes its toxic air, former AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, who heads the department of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders at the institute, tells Somrita Ghosh that pollution is a silent killer that is worsening underlying diseases. He rues the failure of government policies because of a flawed process of formulating them.How do you think the air pollution crisis in Delhi has impacted our lives? We are observing two things: one is the acute effect on the elderly and children - their hospital visits have gone up. I also know people who leave the city during this time for other parts of country, for instance southern India, because the air quality is better there. 
Data also shows that heart attacks go up during this time because of inflammation in the blood vessels caused by PM 2.5 and other ultrafine particulate matter.What long-term effects of this severe air pollution have you seen? Our studies have shown that on 70-80% of days - leaving that one year of Covid - the AQI has either been poor, very poor or severe. So, people living in the Indo-Gangetic plains are continuously breathing air which is of poor quality and that starts affecting their overall health. There are more chances of heart attacks and chronic respiratory problems. In children, it leads to retarded lung growth -- the lungs grow till age of 20, and if you are breathing bad air, then the lung capacity is not as much as it should be. Studies have shown that children growing up in Delhi have poor lung capacity compared to those growing up in southern India. There are studies which say that living in Delhi is a risk factor for heart diseases as much as for high cholesterol. Earlier, the focus was just on lungs and heart but now it has been proved that pollution particles go to the blood and travel to other parts of body; so strokes, dementia and other disorders are being reported.So, are we at a stage where we can directly link air pollution with mortality? Air pollution is a silent killer...other mortality factors can be examined but not pollution. Pollution causes worsening of underlying diseases. If you have a respiratory problem and are exposed to pollution, then respiratory issues worsen. It may also cause lung cancer and heart attack but the links have to be shown. Data is strong in terms of large studies but definite tests are not there. Lancet had said pollution was linked to death of 1.24 million people in 2017. What was interesting about that paper was that it showed that disability adjusted life years (DALY), especially in people with respiratory tract infection, stroke, heart disease and chronic respiratory problems, was affected even more by pollution than smoking. So, we need to develop strategies to deal with this. Otherwise, the burden of disease will continue to increase because of something which is preventable.A lot has been said about policies and measures to curb pollution over so many years but there has been no positive outcome. Why do you think these policies haven't succeeded? We need to develop a strategy for taking all stakeholders on board. We need a strategy for the targeted people -- What are their concerns? It could be socio-economic, regional or ethnic. Secondly, a sustainable solution should be worked out by looking at all sectors and understanding the issues the Indo-Gangetic plain has. It is a landlocked area and, therefore, whenever the air pollution is severe, the smog settles down at ground level. A lot is dependent on the weather in this region unlike in the coastal areas, and, therefore, we have to work aggressively on this. Also, a follow-up of the plans need to be done because if one plan is not working, we need to find alternatives.Do you think all the stakeholders were not considered earlier before making such policies? Policies have been made but somehow the implementation was not right, and we need to find out why. We are talking of crop burning for years and there have been so many solutions but farmers have not accepted them. So, what can we do? How can we incentivise it, so that the farmers get more profit from not burning the stubble? Then there is the whole issue of educating them.What do you think about the measures adopted by the Delhi government -- smog towers, water sprinklers, curbs on vehicle movement etc? We need to generate data to show that these measures are effective because some of them may not be effective. Whether a short-term or a long-term solution, there has to be an analysis to see if it is working, whether it is sustainable and economically viable. Only then should it be implemented. Or, one should move to other ideas. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Jhansi: Premier agricultural research institute official booked for stubble burning on campus,The Times of India (TOI),11-01-2022,KANPUR,"JHANSI: Taking cognizance of the satellite images showing stubble burning inside the campus of Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (IGFRI) - a national institute under the administrative control of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the district administration has lodged a case against the farm in-charge of the institute on Saturday.According to details, it was observed through the satellite images that the farm residue was being burnt, which is otherwise banned in a large portion inside the campus of the prestigious research institute.Taking the matter seriously, the administration ordered officials to lodge a case against the responsible authority of the institute. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged at Sipri Bazar police station on the application of district agriculture officer KK Singh against the farm in-charge at IGFRI.Sipri Bazar station officer JP Pal said that a case has been lodged under different sections of IPC and Environment Protection Act 1986.Talking to TOI, IGFRI director Amresh Chandra regretted the act, saying that it was unknowingly done by the labourers. He, however, clarified that the residue which was burnt was not of crop, but of the fodder grown for the cattle.IGFRI is one of the premier research institutes under ICAR working on fodder crops for the farmers of Bundelkhand since 1962.Stubble burning has emerged as one of the major sources of air pollution in north India. 
According to estimates, about 23 million tonnes of paddy stubble are burnt annually by the farmers in northern India. Burning of stubble produces CO2, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ash (black carbon) and SO2. In the recent years, it has become a major concern in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-NCR and western Uttar Pradesh.Experts say stubble can be used in different ways like cattle feed, compost manure, roofing in rural areas, biomass energy, mushroom cultivation, packing materials, fuel, paper, bioethanol and industrial production.

"Steady winds keep NCR air quality clean, pollution levels to fall further",The Times of India (TOI),12/15/2022,NOIDA,"Noida: The air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad remained in the 'moderate' category for the second consecutive day on Tuesday with the air quality index (AQI) being recorded at 136 and 159, respectively. The AQI in Greater Noida was recorded at 192. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said, ""For the next three days, surface wind speed (8 to 16 km/h) and temperature (max 27-26 degrees C; min 8 degrees C) are likely to improve the AQI. The air quality is likely to remain within 'moderate' or 'lower end of poor' for the next three days due to moderate surface wind speed."" 
A Noida Authority official said that they have been sprinkling water from STPs to mitigate the dust pollution. The Authority also tweeted photos of some tankers sprinkling water on roads in sectors 37, 38, 126, 135 and others. The minimum temperature recorded in Noida on Tuesday was 14.2 degrees Celsius and maximum was 26.1 degrees Celsius temperatures with fog in the morning. Ghaziabad recorded the minimum at 12.9 degrees Celsius and maximum 25.1 degrees Celsius temperatures. Meanwhile, Delhi's air quality improved remarkably and turned 'moderate' with a clean sky and cool north-westerly winds making it a soothing Tuesday.
The air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 177 as against 218 a day earlier and 306 on Sunday. This is the cleanest air the city has breathed since October 15 when the AQI was 186. This is also the cleanest December day in at least two years, as none of the days in December 2021 saw moderate air quality. On December 14, 2020, the AQI was 160.
According to pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality may improve further due to persistent winds and clear sky, which support ventilation of pollutants.
""The relatively stronger winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail from December 13 to 15. The air quality is likely to improve further and remain in the moderate category on December 14. It may deteriorate marginally but remain in the same category on December 15. It will reach the poor category on December 16,"" stated the air quality early warning system.The maximum temperature hovered around 26 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 8.9 degrees Celsius.

"CM Arvind Kejriwal's statements false, fabricated,twisted, says Delhi LG VK Saxena",The Times of India (TOI),1/15/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: In a stinging rebuttal to CM Arvind Kejriwal's statements at his press conference, LG V K Saxena has accused him of attributing to him ""misleading, patently false and fabricated"" statements.""All statements attributed by the CM to the LG at his press conference after the meeting with regards to orders of the Supreme Court, powers as administrator, supremacy over all subjects and directions to officers are misleading, patently false and fabricated and twisted to suit a particular agenda. These statements are categorically denied,"" said the LG's office. Work for development of city, LG tells CMIn a rebuttal to CM Arvind Kejriwal's press conference, LG V K Saxena's office said, ""The CM will also be well advised to function in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, parliamentary acts and Supreme Court's judgments and refrain from running down an existing law just because it has been challenged in a court of law.""Saxena said in a statement that he had taken up the issue of jurisdiction over certain subjects raised by the CM through various letters in the past few days and briefed him on his constitutional position and powers under various acts, statutes and court directions.The LG urged Kejriwal not to ""politicise"" every issue and asked him to work for the development of Delhi with ""administrative effectiveness and fiscal prudence"" in line with the Constitution.The AAP government, however, called the statement ""malicious"" and alleged that the LG's office had ""cooked up"" stories about things which were never discussed at the meeting. 
Raj Niwas said the LG reiterated at the meeting that he was ""singularly bound by the Constitution"" in discharge of his duties. ""All his actions/decisions had been in conformity with the Constitution, acts of Parliament, statutes and judgments given by courts, from time to time,"" the statement read.Stressing that the well-being of people was the prime concern of both, the LG's office said Saxena deliberated with Kejriwal on various issues related to governance, administration and development of Delhi and flagged areas that needed attention. The statement added that ""immoral"" continuation of Satyendar Jain as a minister despite him being in prison for long was among the issues raised by the LG.""Illegal appointment of private persons as government nominees on boards of private power distribution companies instead of government officers, despite written objections from two previous lieutenant governors, delay in projects of national and public importance, including redevelopment of AIIMS (and construction of) new academic blocks in IIT, expansion of Metro and NHAI works (and) corruption in government departments cropped up in the discussion,"" said the statement.""Broken and potholed roads, air pollution and worsening condition of the Yamuna, no new hospital, school, college and flyover in the last eight years, encroachment of the river floodplains, worsened drainage system leading to severe waterlogging and no effort to clean the Najafgarh drain were other issues,"" it added.Raj Niwas added that the LG urged the CM to focus on the issues of the city and gave examples of the removal of over 40 lakh metric tonnes of garbage from three landfill sites and cleaning of more than 10km of the Najafgarh drain in just six months. ""This was the result of the concerted efforts on part of various agencies, regular field visits and constant monitoring,"" the statement quoted the LG as telling Kejriwal at the meeting. The Delhi government, however, accused the LG of cooking up stories. ""The LG's office has cooked up stories (on issues) that were never discussed at the meeting. It seems that the LG's office had already typed and prepared a dossier from its coloured lens before the meeting and was ready to share it with the media irrespective of what took place at the meeting,"" the government said in a statement.""We strongly condemn such agenda-driven politics being played out in the name of a constitutional office. Raj Niwas must abstain from pointing guns at the elected government in such a manner. The LG has clearly been subverting the Constitution and the law of the land and it does not suit him to cook up stories to defend his obstructionist working,"" it added.

Empower local bodies to resolve urban emissions: Experts in Delhi,The Times of India (TOI),2/23/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Local institutions and bodies must be empowered to resolve issues related to air pollution and urban emissions, according to experts.A seminar on urban emissions, climate and health hazards held on Tuesday by Delhi Technological University's department of environmental engineering sought to bring together experts from various fields to discuss the causes and effects of urban emissions.
Track the pollution level in your cityThe discussion focused on exploring possible solutions to urban pollution by strengthening policies and the role of educational institutions in contributing towards better air quality. It also touched upon the importance of smart mobility and air quality forecasting systems.Speaking at the seminar, Rajeev Kumar Mishra, assistant professor, department of environmental engineering, DTU, stressed on the need to look for solutions ""locally and readily available"" in order to resolve the existing issues of urban pollution.""For instance, to resolve dust pollution in my area, there should be a system wherein I can take MCD's aid quickly, rather than waiting for CPCB or DPCC for a solution. For this, we need to do capacity building for local institutions, such as MCD, and also enhance the capabilities of academic institutes like DTU, IITs and other universities and state-level colleges,"" said Mishra.Mishra added, ""Governments must ensure their participation in resolving local air quality woes. Educational institutes must be engaged to sensitise residents in their cities and work in coordination with the municipalities to control urban emissions.""DTU had earlier released research stating that the existing pollution under control (PUC) certification to control emissions from vehicles in Delhi is flawed.

"Breathing ailments killed 13,500 in 5 years: BMC data",The Times of India (TOI),03-06-2023,MUMBAI,"MUMBAI: Non-Covid respiratory ailments, including asthma, claimed 13,444 lives in Mumbai in the past five years, shows BMC data.The data assume significance at a time when the city is reeling under the unusual phenomenon of high air pollution levels in summer, and doctors' clinics are overrun with patients with allergies or throat infection and dry cough that persists for two to three weeks.'Air pollution indirect cause of death in respiratory ailments'BMC data shows over 1,000 deaths every year, roughly 1% of the total deaths in the city, occur due to asthma, a lung disease in which the airways get narrow and blocked by excess mucus. Even common chest infections such as acute bronchiolitis led to death in over 20 children every year. However, BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the data is not a reflection of the severity of air pollution. 
""This data is a compilation of death as per ICD (international classification of death) coding. Many doctors, especially those not attached to medical colleges and hospitals, are not often accurate in their ICD classification,"" she said.A senior civic hospital doctor said based on the present ICD data, it cannot be said air pollution leads to high mortality. However, a study released by the NGO Greenpeace-Southeast Asia in 2021 said Mumbai ranked fifth globally in annual deaths due to air pollution, with 25,000 deaths occurring in 2020. Delhi was the highest with 54,000 deaths related to air pollution the same year. Dr Salil Bendre, who heads the department of chest medicine at Nanavati Hospital, Juhu, said while air pollution worsens the symptoms of chronic pulmonary conditions such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), ""it is the repeated infections that cause a problem"". COPD is considered a preventable disease that worsens due to air pollution and causes 8.7% of the total deaths in India. ""It is not an asthmatic attack or COPD exacerbation that suddenly kills a person, it's the effect of years of such attacks on lungs. The lungs get so weakened that the probability of death increases,'' he said. In other words, air pollution is an indirect cause of death in the person. Air pollution-related morbidity has been high this year so far. Internal medicine specialist Dr Shobha Subramanian Itolikar from Fortis Hospital, Mulund said she is seeing many young people, especially those who step out to work, coming in with acute respiratory illness. ""After Covid, acute respiratory illness is leading to an overwhelming rise in the number of patients coming in with breathing difficulty,'' she said. Patients come in with complaints of severe breathlessness or unrelenting cough that disturbs their sleep. ""Most of the cases are due to acute allergic bronchitis, viral bronchitis or viral pneumonia, and the plummeting air quality is worsening the problem,"" said Dr Subramanian Itolikar. Dr Bendra concurred, saying patients coming in with pollution-related problems are higher than those with flurelated respiratory problems. ""However, at times, patients themselves contribute to the burden by not complying with treatment. Inhalers are the best treatment option for patients with asthma and COPD, but many refuse to continue with it when they start feeling better,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Failure to comply with norms: Pay 2cr, NHAI told",The Times of India (TOI),03-11-2023,CHANDIGARH,"Chandigarh: Coming down heavily on the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for failing to comply with environmental obligations while constructing of eight-lane highway No. 44 from Mukarba Chowk to Singhu border, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the highway authority to pay Rs 2 crore as compensation.
The tribunal has clarified that the NHAI would be free to recover the amount from erring officers/contractors following due process of law. ""Air pollution control norms are an essential component of sustainable development. Any activity resulting in generation of dust has to be accompanied by dust control measures that have not been taken. Remedial action may be taken expeditiously and for the past violation, we require the NHAI to pay compensation of Rs. 2 crore to be deposited with the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), head of forestry force (HoFF), Haryana within one month. This will be in addition to levy of compensation by any other authority,"" observed the tribunal in its detailed orders.
The NGT has also clarified that the amount of Rs 2 crore shall be utilized for restoration measures in the area by suitable plantation in addition to the remedial measures to be taken by the NHAI by preparing an action plan with the approval of joint committee of CPCB and director (environment), Delhi, within one month. The approved plan may be executed within three months.
The copy of the order has been forwarded to the chief secretary, Haryana; chief secretary, Delhi; chairman, NHAI; PCCF (HoFF), Haryana; CPCB and director (environment), Delhi, for compliance. The NGT bench headed by its chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel has passed these orders while hearing an application filed by one Prem Prakash Prajapati.
Grievance in the application was against failure of the NHAI in complying with its environmental obligations in the course of construction of eight-lane highway No. 44 from Mukarba Chowk to Singhu border, Delhi. It was stated that near Khampur village a lot of dust is generated in absence of sprinkling of water. Other hotspots are Palla-Mod, Singhola Mod, Vaishnav Dhaba to Khampur village.

'Smog towers not effective at city level',The Times of India (TOI),03-11-2023,MUMBAI,"Mumbai: Some experts on Thursday said the BMC decision to set up smog towers could turn out to be a ""white elephant"". They were speaking at a webinar organised by city NGO Waatavaran.
Owing to Mumbai's worsening air quality the BMC in its budget last month announced 14 smog towers.
Dr Abhijeet Chatterjee, associate professor, Bose Institute, department of science and technology, said: ""Smog towers as per the scientific evidence are only effective in cleaning the indoor air where the amount of air driven is minimal and released back in a small and closed space like a room. It is absurd to think that these systems could be effective on a city level.""
Dr K V George, senior principal scientist and head, air pollution control division, NEERI, said: ""Even if the towers operate at more than 100% efficiency, they will not be able to purify the ambient air due to its scale.""

Air quality turns 'poor' in Patna,The Times of India (TOI),04-01-2023,PATNA,"PATNA: Despite the early onset of summer and rising temperature (above normal), air pollution in the city remained higher than usual during this time of the year. Patna's air quality index (AQI) jumped to the ""poor"" category on Thursday from ""moderate"" on Wednesday.The overall pollution level of the city has gone up by 33 notches and it was recorded at 212 on Thursday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin released at 4pm. On Wednesday, the AQI level was at 179. Experts said the main cause behind the summer pollution was rise in the concentration level of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10), dust from the construction sites and the vehicular movement.Arun Kumar, a senior scientist and air pollution expert at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said the dust-laden wind has been impacting the air quality of Patna despite the favourable meteorological conditions. 
""In recent past, it was seen that air pollution level rises during summer as the weather warms up and the wind velocity increases, due to which higher concentration of coarse particle is seen in the environment,"" he said.Kumar added that due to rise in temperature, the soil and silt deposited near the river becomes dry and easily spreads in the air with the wind. ""The main reason is the alluvial soil, which is very light and found in abundance (almost 98% soil) in the state. Dust particles from construction sites and vehicular movement have also attributed in the rise in air pollution,"" Kumar said.""The BSPCB has developed a portal to register complaint about open construction work, burning of biomass and garbage, open transportation of construction materials and other environment issues. The department concerned will find solutions to these problems and take the action accordingly,"" Kumar added.As far as vehicular dust is concerned, Kumar said steps are being taken to curb the pollution and smoke emission form the vehicles. ""Diesel autos are already banned in the city while diesel-run buses will also go off the roads this year,"" he said.The average concentrations of PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron) stood at 64 micrograms per cubic metre (g/m3) on Thursday, which is almost 4.3 times more than the permissible limit. If the level goes to 35, the air is considered unhealthy and can cause health issues to those suffering from breathing problem and asthma. The PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) was recorded at 139 g/m3 on Thursday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". According to the CPCB, the ""poor"" air can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Rain gives pollution a break in Pune, Delhi, Mumbai",The Times of India (TOI),05-12-2023,PUNE,"PUNE: Worsening pollution levels got a break this year, with Pune, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad witnessing a significant decline in pollutants PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations both in March and April 2023 as compared to the same period the previous year, SAFAR-IITM data showed, reports Neha Madaan.SAFAR-IITM experts said the air quality in some of the major cities in India has been the best during the season since 2021, largely due to frequent rain spells received in many parts of the country. Delhi witnessed a 32% decrease in PM 10 concentration in March this year (135.5 g/m) compared to the same period in 2022 (197.9 g/m).The national capital also saw a significant drop in this pollutant of nearly 33% in April this year (164.5 g/ m3 ) in comparison to last April (247 g/m3 ). PM 2.5 concentrations in Delhi reduced by 23% in March (62 g/m3 ) and 33% in April (57.7 g/m3 ) this year, in comparison to the same period last year (80 g/m3 in March 2022 and 85.8 g/m3 in April 2022). Pune, too, saw a reduction in the pollution levels, with PM 10 concentrations dropping by 14% this March (92 g/m3 ) compared to last March (107 g/m3 ), and falling by 20% in April (77 g/m3 ) compared to last year (96 g/m3 ). PM 2.5 levels also dropped in the city over the last two months, to 57 g/m3 in March and 44 g/m3 in April this year. 
Last year, these values were 65 g/m3 in March and 58 g/m3 in April. The trend was not limited to Delhi and Pune alone. Mumbai and Ahmedabad also saw similar drops in March and April this year. SAFAR-IITM experts attributed the reduction in pollution levels to the frequent rain spells received in many parts of India this season. Rain plays a significant role in washing away pollutants, which is why the monsoon season has the least polluted air in India. A SAFAR-IITM scientist said, ""One of the main ways by which rain spells can reduce pollution is by 'washing away' pollutants from the air and depositing them on the ground. This process is known as wet deposition. It can help remove particulate matter and other pollutants from the atmosphere. Additionally, rain can help disperse pollutants by mixing them with air currents and diluting their concentration in the atmosphere.""Another way that rain can help control pollution is by reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone. ""When the atmosphere is dry, pollutants react with sunlight to form ozone, which can be harmful. When it rains, the moisture in the air helps reduce the amount of ozone that is formed,"" the scientist said. The SAFAR data, in this report, did not include ozone concentrations in these cities.

28 tonnes of silt removed from Trichy city roads,The Times of India (TOI),6/17/2023,TRICHY,"Trichy: The Trichy Corporation organised a synchronised cleanliness drive to remove dust and silt accumulated on roads in all five zones of the city. The exclusive drive focused on cleaning the silt from both arterial and residential roads saw around 28 tonnes of dust/silt removed from roads. The silt and dust resuspend into the atmosphere and affect the ambient air quality.
A study conducted by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Trichy city's air quality index in 2021 found that dust and silt accumulated on roads account for 42% of air pollution in the city.
The chief contributor to air pollution was exhaust from vehicles (45%). Based on the directives from TNPCB, corporation procured automated road sweepers, mini-road cleaners and trucks with water sprinklers. Subsequently, a drive aimed at improving the air quality index (AQI) was planned on Wednesday by deploying workers and machinery. 
In zone V, 10.2 tonnes of silt were removed, the highest among the five zones. In zone I and zone II, 6.9 tonnes and 5.4 tonnes of silt were removed respectively. ""Most of the silt was accumulated along with the centre medians. As we have laid new end-to-end roads without leaving space, we expect the silt accumulation to come down gradually,"" an official source said. 
The civic body has planned to continue the drive periodically.

"Rural, urban PM2.5 improves in Bengal: Study",The Times of India (TOI),07-07-2023,KOLKATA,"KOLKATA: Fine particulate pollution (caused by PM2.5) has dipped sharply in Bengal- 14.9% in urban areas and 15.9% in rural areas - between 2017 and 2022, according to a study. The finding was consistent with a downward in PM2.5 levels across the country.
Track the pollution level in your cityThe study, conducted by Climate Trends, a private research-based consulting and capacity building initiative, analysed two sets of data: IIT-Delhi professor Sagnik Dey's SAANS (Satellite-Based Application For Air Quality Monitoring and Management at National Scale) data for PM2.5 estimation and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) data for urban and rural classification.PM2.5 are fine particles, with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, exposure to which can cause a host of health problems, from respiratory problems to cancer. The downward trend, noticed nationally, also reveals that the urban-rural divide in PM2.5 pollution has narrowed in the last few years. Across India, rural regions saw PM2.5 levels decline by 19.1% and urban regions recorded an 18.7% dip in PM 2.5 levels between 2017 and 2022, according to an analysis of the 1km x 1km satellite data available from IIT-Delhi. The analysis indicates that particulate pollution is a national concern, not just limited to specific regions.""States in the Indo-Gangetic Plain - such as Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Bihar - have seen a significant dip in PM2.5 levels, indicating that the focus of the air pollution fight continues to remain in the region,"" said Aarti Khosla, Climate Trends director. ""However, western states like Maharashtra and Gujarat have made little progress and have seen pollution become more significant.""Despite year-on-year improvements in the Indo-Gangetic Plain states vs other states, the 2022 PM2.5 averages for both rural and urban areas in the country showed that levels remained above the Central Pollution Control Board's annual safe limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. The comparison between states that have National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) norms, versus those which don't, show a similar trend. This implies every Indian has had long-term exposure to air pollution. The study highlighted the need to address air pollution on a broader scale, rather than focusing solely on urban areas.""This analysis clearly indicates that India is inching towards plateauing its upward-rising air pollution levels since 2016-2017. This is a positive achievement. However, the challenge now lies towards bringing the needle down further, especially as we are in the last year of the National Clean Air Programme's (NCAP) targets of reducing 20%-30% particulate matter levels by 2024,"" said IIT professor Sagnik Dey, whose data for PM2.5 estimation was used for the study.With a reduction of 37.8% and 38.1% in urban and rural PM2.5 levels, Uttar Pradesh recorded the best progress between 2017 and 2022. Maharashtra was the worst performing state, with only a dip of 7.7% in urban PM2.5 levels, while with a decrease of 8.2% in rural PM2.5 levels, Gujarat made the least progress. Ten states witnessed an upward trajectory in urban and rural regions since the pandemic in 2020: Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Telangana, Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar, Chandigarh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Emissions from power plants can form clouds: Study,The Times of India (TOI),8/13/2023,CHENNAI,"Chennai: A study led by IIT Madras has found that sulphur dioxide in emissions from power plants converts into aerosols rich in sulphate that can form clouds. The study also found that sulphur dioxide emitted from the Neyveli power plant travelled all the way to Chennai and in the process generated secondary aerosols after undergoing a chemical reaction 
The study was conducted during the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown when emissions from vehicles and other industries were relatively low but power plants were functioning. Researchers said the study may provide key scientific insights for framing policies to curb PM2.5. 
Prof Sachin S Gunthe, department of civil engineering, IITM, who led the international research team, said, ""Our study provides a rare opportunity to examine the sensitivity of cloud-forming aerosol particles to new particle formation and growth due to SO2 emissions from a coal-fired power plant under relatively cleaner conditions. These findings have important implications for assessing the climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosols and highlight the need for comprehensive emission control measures."" 
Researchers said during lockdown when emissions from vehicles and other industries stopped, the sulphur dioxide in the gas emissions from power plants interacted with the atmosphere and underwent oxidation before converting into small particles or aerosols very rich in sulphate, which have the potential to form clouds. 
On other days, when emissions from vehicles and other industries are also in the atmosphere, the gas condenses onto the pre-existing particles as they have a larger surface area. 
""Implementing aggressive measures to reduce particulate pollution originating from traffic and various industrial sources within coastal regions such as Chennai might lead to outcomes that work against the intended goals. As a result, there is a pressing need for comprehensive reconsideration and the exploration of alternative strategies to address air pollution at the regional level effectively,"" an IITM release said.

"To decongest Bengaluru, urban experts suggest 30-min model",The Times of India (TOI),9/24/2023,BENGALURU,"BENGALURU: If food, medicine or grocery ordered online can reach our doorstep in 30 minutes, why does it take hours on end for citizens to commute to work, school and for recreation in Bengaluru? Why cannot city administrators ensure these commutes too are wrapped up within 30 minutes? These are questions that often crop up in the minds of Bengalureans who brave perennial traffic snarls on choked city streets.Seeking to emulate this swift service delivery model, prominent policy thinkers and urban planners have now suggested that the state government adopt the 30-minute city concept in Bengaluru to streamline the availability of citizen services, including transportation, commute to work or catching up with friends and family in the neighbourhood. 
Their suggestions are part of a recent comprehensive report - Karnataka's Decade - Roadmap to $1 Trillion Economy - prepared by the planning, programme monitoring and statistics department and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and released recently. The report seeks to draw a roadmap for Karnataka to emerge as a $1-trillion economy by 2033. Referring to the new concept, an urban thinker who was part of the roadmap planning, said: ""Despite its economic ability, Bengaluru lags many Indian cities on several civic and infrastructural parameters. Rapid urbanisation and economic growth have resulted in haphazard development across Bengaluru, impacting the health of citizens and the environment. We call ourselves a global leader in innovation, but at the same time, quality of life in the city continues to be poor. This is where the globally fast-catching concept of 30-minute city can help in resolving this urban mess and ensuring availability of all crucial services needed for a citizen in a day around their neighbourhood.""Stating that the 30-minute city concept is fast catching up with developing countries as part of their sustainable development strategies, the policymakers added, ""The concept highlights the ability to meet most of our everyday needs locally, within minutes of stepping out of home by either by walking, cycling, riding or using public transport. Also, the concept helps strengthen the city's municipal governance model which wields very little power at this juncture, given the fact that all decisions are taken at the government level. It is pertinent to decentralise governance and empower the metropolitan wards by creating these facilities accessible within 30 minutes."" Listing out the advantages of the 30-minute city concept, the report said, ""Increased walkability and bikeability will lead to increased physical activity ensuring improved health. It reduces reliance on cars, curbing congestion and air pollution. Besides, it also improves spatial connectedness, encouraging social cohesion and community interaction. The concept also increases economic development by creating opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive."" The report noted that neighbourhoods that are walkable, bikeable and replete with transit options contribute to empowerment of communities. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Up for a joyride? Your safety, your problem",The Times of India (TOI),10/23/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Before excitedly mounting a giant wheel in one of the many fairs dotting the city, it may be sobering to know that once up in the air, it's just you.A tragedy was averted on Wednesday after a giant wheel with people stopped mid-air at a fair in Narela, following which Delhi fire services rescued 20 people. A case was registered under IPC sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery) and 336 (act endangering the life or personal safety of others).At a Ramlila fair at Red Fort, a joyride called ""cross wheel"" malfunctioned too. A passenger cabin inside which children were sitting fell off, injuring a child. 
Days later, the ride was fixed by the foreman and was ready for operation. No case was registered after the accident.""The cross ride is like a giant wheel but tilted. That day, the bolt came loose due to which the passenger cabin fell off. Luckily, the cabin was close to the ground when it got tilted and the child did not suffer major injuries. We have now fixed the ride and it is set to run,"" the operator of the ride said.A quick check at the big fairs in the city, including the fair at Ramlila Maidan, Red Fort and IP Extension, showed that at most places, safety norms are the last thing operators or revellers think about.According to the norms, to install joy rides at fairs or amusement parks, organisers have to take permission from Delhi police and MCD. ""They (organisers of the fair) write to local police and MCD to check the safety measures. We seek a structure stability report. If the report is okay, we give permission,"" a senior police officer said.MCD officials said it has the responsibility to report on a joyride's working condition after an inspection. ""The organisers have the responsibility to carry out the maintenance daily before operation,"" an official said. Additionally, there are a series of rules such as fitness certificates shall be issued to only Delhi-based Joy Ride Association Members or to firms based in Delhi. Also, owners should arrange for the display of safety measures, and entry/exit plan for each joyride. They should have adequate first aid arrangements. Owners must adhere to government rules for air and noise pollution. In most fairs the rules are flouted.When asked if any of the riders were informed about dos and don'ts while being on the ride or if they saw safety measures written somewhere, most people said they had not. Most operators did not have any first aid arrangements. Asked if foremen have to submit any report for maintenance of their joyride, most operators seemed unaware of such a thing.Shivam (25), who was getting down from a giant wheel, along with his friends, said: ""We just buy a ticket and hop on without being told anything on what to do if the ride breaks or gets jammed. It's all a risk. If something happens midway, then it's a bad day for someone."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

A grid plan that can watch and check NCR pollution,The Times of India (TOI),10/15/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: Scientists at CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) are working on a grid-based mitigation strategy to watch and check air pollution across the National Capital Region (NCR).The entire NCR can be divided into small grids, akin to tiles, called Local Area Management Plan (LAMP). A network of stationary and mobile sensors can be used to monitor each area. 
Track the pollution level in your cityEach tile or LAMP - unique to that area - will be spread over an area of 2x2 square kilometres. Air pollution sources can be identified, their activity levels quantified along with daily pollutant emission loads. While NEERI has already done the exercise in Wazirpur, it is now working in the Siri Fort area and Bahadurgarh (Haryana).The approach is to treat air pollution at a local level, keeping in mind the diverse requirements of each area, instead of opting for a one-size-fits-all policy.A research article, titled Development of Strategic Air Quality Improvement Framework for Urban Hotspots, published by CSIR-NEERI in a reputed peer-reviewed journal, used a grid of tiles in the Wazirpur area pollution hotspot for summer and winter (summer from April to June 2019 and winter from December 2019 to January 2020).The study findings indicated that Wazirpur, an urban industrial area, saw high PM2.5 levels during winter followed by the summer season. The daily PM2.5 values were in the range 36-195 g/m3 during summer and 92-433 g/m3 in winter. The concentrations exceeded the daily standards of 60 g/m3, 80% of the time in summer and 100% of the time in winter, the study found.Out of the overall sources, road dust and industries were found to be the prominent emission sources emitting 53% and 28% as reflected in the PM2.5 concentrations. ""Using developed framework (based on pollution reduction associated cost, social impact and ease of enforcement), the prioritized control actions for better air quality in the study area were identified- dust cleaning by mechanized vacuum machine, operation of industries with full capacity during day time only, installation of cyclone dust collector in industrial stacks, and increase in stack height by 50%,"" said the study.""It is inferred that heterogeneous trends at the local level necessitates strategic and a smart criteria-based air quality management plan for designing any control intervention. The developed framework can aid regulatory agencies or urban local bodies in managing air quality at the local level,"" said the study, whose authors are Prachi Goyal, Sunil Gulia and SK Goyal.Speaking at the India Clean Air Summit (ICAS) 2023 in August, SK Goyal, the chief scientist and head (professor, AcSIR), CSIR-NEERI, Delhi Zonal Centre, said: ""We will develop a grid-based mitigation strategy, termed 'Local Area Management Plan' (LAMP), for a hotspot, as a conceptual model for each season. The 'one size fits all' approach has rarely worked for air pollution mitigation. Hence, rather than similar actions across the city, LAMP will allow policymakers to have grid-wise mitigation and will make urban air pollution more manageable.""

"Check stubble burning, LG tells Haryana, Punjab CMs",The Times of India (TOI),10/15/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: With the incidents of stubble burning in the neighbouring states on a rise, lieutenant governor VK Saxena wrote to the chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab on Saturday and urged them to take remedial measures to check the practice.In his letters, Saxena mentioned that the incidents of stubble burning recorded between September 15 and October 11 this year in both Haryana and Punjab were higher than the corresponding period in 2022 and urged them to ""galvanise"" all resources to defeat the deadly menace and help the residents of Delhi-NCR towns breathe easy.The city's air quality remained in the 'poor' category for the third consecutive day with the Air Quality Index of 257 on Saturday. In his letter to Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, Saxena said it was ""extremely worrisome"" that the incidents of crop residue burning events in the border state between September 15 and October 11 this year reached 1063, which was 300 more than the figure in the corresponding period during 2022.""Between October 24 and November 2, there had been an increase of 19 per cent in the incident of parali burning, in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. You would also recall that, last year, of the five states that affect Delhi's air quality, Punjab had remained the only non-performing outlier,"" the LG said in his letter, adding that both Mann and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had assured that the eventuality will not be repeated.TOI could not get a response from the Delhi government on this.In a separate communication to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, the LG said his state had done ""exemplarily"" last year by controlling stubble burning. 
""It is extremely worrisome that the incidents of crop residue burning events in Haryana during September 15 to October 11 this year have reached 340, which is 257 more than the figure of 83 in the corresponding period during 2022,"" Saxena said.Saxena further said he expected both the chief ministers to expedite remedial measures to prevent parali burning and save Delhi from choking in winters. ""I am sure that you are seized of the matter and urge you to galvanise all available resources and make the farmers willing partners in defeating this deadly menace,"" he wrote to both Mann and Khattar.Saxena said being the national capital, Delhi housed the Parliament, Supreme Court and all diplomatic missions representing the globe, besides its two crore inhabitants. ""It hosts lakhs of visitors, tourists and envoys coming to India for summits and conferences, who are exposed to debilitating air pollution, for no fault of theirs. This inter alia also has a bearing on the nation's international image and standing,"" the LG said.He added that Delhi was taking all steps to ensure that local causes of air pollution were fully addressed.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said the residents of the capital were grateful to the LG for writing letters to the chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab to curb farm residual burning.

Air pollution updates may be up again soon,The Times of India (TOI),10/28/2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: With TOI flagging the missing air quality data for Delhi-NCR from the government-managed public platform, the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) on Friday said it would resume making those crucial figures on air pollution public after resolving the issue of multiplicity of existing forecasting systems in the next 2-3 days.IITM which works under the ministry of earth sciences (MoES) used to generate two sources of air-quality forecasts for Delhi-NCR - first was based on the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) system while the second was based on Air Quality Early Warning System and Decision Support System.
Track the pollution level in your city ""There were differences in the air-quality forecasts between the two forecasting systems, particularly with regard to the contribution of stubble (biomass) burning on the air-quality over Delhi. Additionally, it was noted that there were also differences in the grading of air quality categories between the two systems,"" said the IITM in a statement.Noting that the air-quality information generated from the two forecast systems was confusing for the general public, it said, ""This matter was discussed among the scientists at IITM, India Meteorological Department (IMD) and MoES. Based on the discussions, it is agreed that a single source of air-quality information should be made available to the general public from the IITM website. ""Presently, the scientists from IITM, IMD and MoES are working to resolve this issue in the next 2-3 days.""SAFAR data on share of fire count (stubble burning) was discontinued on October 13 whereas the decision support system which used to estimate the contribution of local sources in the overall particulate matter (PM2.5) had stopped sharing the information publicly from Tuesday.

"Post Diwali, air quality in city turns ‘moderate’",The Times of India (TOI),11/17/2023,LUCKNOW,"Lucknow: After witnessing high air pollution levels post Diwali, Lucknow’s air quality remained ‘moderate’ for the second consecutive day on Thursday.
As per the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city was 191.
On Monday and Tuesday, the city continued to be under the ‘poor’ air quality category with AQI recording at 213 and 206 respectively due to bursting of crackers.
“The drop in the pollution levels does not mean that things have improved. It is just the weather factor like high wind speed that has dispersed the pollutants. The moment the temperatures and wind velocity go down, the air quality will deteriorate again,” said environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta.

"Mumbai air pollution: 350 BEST buses to get air-purifiers, traffic hotspots to get filtration chimneys",The Times of India (TOI),11-02-2023,AUTO-NEWS,"In an effort to combat rising air pollution in Mumbai, the city is implementing various technological counter-measures. The municipal authority is fitting vehicle-mounted air filters on 350 BEST buses, installing virtual chimneys at high traffic congestion spots, placing special streetlights, and implementing air purification systems in select gardens. These actions are part of a comprehensive strategy to address air quality issues, as per a PTI report.In a phased approach, 150 BEST buses will initially be fitted with detachable air filters to remove impurities from dust and particles. 
Subsequently, an additional 200 buses will undergo the same process. Minister Kesarkar suggested the introduction of new electric buses equipped with vehicle-mounted filters to expedite the installation of air filtration devices.In response to deteriorating air quality, the Maharashtra government has issued guidelines for air pollution mitigation, which the city civic body is now actively implementing. As part of the technological measures, ten virtual chimneys will be installed at high-traffic congestion locations to carry out extensive filtration. Additionally, ""Vayu"" streetlights will be installed at 50 locations to purify the air.Mumbai district guardian minister, Deepak Kesarkar, explained that the municipal body has taken several steps, including ordering 30 vehicles equipped with sprinklers, commonly known as fog cannons, to mitigate pollution. Notices have also been served to readymix concrete units, and industries have been directed to increase the height of their chimneys. To oversee the implementation of these technologies, both the Maharashtra Environment Department and the Mumbai civic chief are actively monitoring their progress.IIT Bombay is collaborating with various companies to test and assess new technologies for pollution reduction. Six technologies, including vehicle-mounted air filters, have been identified for trial implementation. The effectiveness of these technologies will determine their priority in the city's pollution control efforts. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Kanpur’s AQI 201, morning walkers advised to mask up",The Times of India (TOI),11-05-2023,KANPUR,"Kanpur: Air quality index of Kanpur is an unhealthy 223. As per norms it is good if PM2.5 g/m3 averaged level is less than 12.5 over 24 hours, and if it is in the bracket of 12. 5-25, it is fair and it is poor if in the bracket of 25-50. More than 50-100 is very poor. Saturday’s AQI level in the city was 201, which comes under the very poor category. 
AS per the WHO annual air quality guideline value, the city is facing 10.9 more PM 2.5 concentration which is the main source of air pollution. 
According to Dr S N Shukla, this quality of is unhealthy for sensitive persons and advised them to reduce outdoor activities and wear a mask when stepping out. “Close windows to avoid dirty outdoor air and if possible get a monitor. Run an air purifier to make room air fresh,” said the doctor.
He stated that since the morning temperature was dipping and air was laden with dew, morning walkers should take care of themselves and wear a mask.
Kanpur sees its air pollution problem mainlyfrom emission of vehicles and factories. The accumulation of dust and dirt rising within the city also plays a large role, along with human activities such as wood burning in homes, burning of garbage in the open, cooking.,excessive use of generators, very poor road conditions, and traffic congestion.

Air pollution: Centre orders ban on non-essential construction work in Delhi-NCR,The Times of India (TOI),11-03-2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: The pollution control panel at the Center on Thursday issued instructions to prohibit non-essential construction activities in Delhi-NCR and restrict the entry of diesel-consuming trucks into the capital, as the air quality in the city deteriorated to the 'severe' category.CHECK THE GRAP STAGES: 
Stage age I|| Stage II || Stage III || Stage IVThis measure is being implemented as part of Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is the central government's air pollution control strategy designed for execution in the region during the winter season.At 5 pm, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was recorded at 402.During a meeting to assess the air quality situation in Delhi-NCR, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a regulatory body tasked with formulating strategies to combat pollution in the region, reported that pollution levels are anticipated to rise further due to unfavorable meteorological and climatic conditions.The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) classifies its actions into four stages based on the Air Quality Index (AQI) levels:Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300)Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400)Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450)Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI 450)These stages guide the implementation of appropriate measures to address air quality concerns in the region.In Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), there is a comprehensive suspension of construction and demolition activities, with exceptions made for essential government projects, mining, and stone crushing operations.This stringent measure is put in place to mitigate the adverse impact of air pollution and protect public health when air quality reaches the 'Severe' category (AQI 401-450). In Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), restrictions are imposed on the entry of certain vehicles to combat air pollution.This includes a ban on the entry of light commercial vehicles registered outside Delhi, as well as diesel-guzzling trucks, and medium and heavy goods vehicles, except those engaged in essential services. These measures are implemented to reduce vehicular emissions and improve air quality when the air quality index reaches the 'Severe' category (AQI 401-450). For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Pollution problem to climate crisis, IIT Open House tries to address all",The Times of India (TOI),11-05-2023,DELHI,"NEW DELHI: From finding solutions to air pollution and disaster housing to climate crisis mitigation and detecting landslides, the 16th annual Open House at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, had over 2,000 school students from more than 40 schools participating on Saturday. One of the standout projects, titled 'Sustainable and Affordable Homes using Agro-Residues: A Step Towards a Green Future', led by Kusum Saini, a PhD scholar, and Vasant Matsagar, professor of civil engineering, aims to turn agricultural solid waste into a valuable resource that addresses air pollution and the lack of housing, especially in remote areas. The building units for these sustainable and affordable homes are made from biocomposites of wheat and rice residues. 
The project, part of startup company BIOCOM Structures, is funded by the Industrial Research and Development at IIT-D. Saini explained, ""These homes are easy to assemble and can be used in remote areas as permanent structures, healthcare facilities and disaster relief shelters. These biodegradable building units help address waste disposal challenges in high-altitude areas and reduce the carbon footprint associated with synthetic construction materials."" During the event, Rangan Banerjee, IIT-D director, said, ""The objective of Open House is to show school students what IIT-Delhi is doing in science and technology and showcase our work in areas that impact the real world. The idea is to encourage school students to make informed decisions about their future."" Sunil Jha, chairman of Open House 2023, expressed satisfaction, saying, ""Continuing the tradition of the last 15 years, Open House 2023 provided an insight into path-breaking research work, student projects and the numerous advanced facilities and laboratories available at IIT Delhi to the school students."" The IIT Delhi Alumni Association recognised the outstanding projects at Open House and awarded prizes worth Rs 2.15 lakh to the researchers. One of the projects was an 'Easy-to-use Deep Learning based Landslide Detection Tool' developed by civil engineering students, including Ria Joshi and Harshul Malik, under the guidance of professor Manabendra Saharia and PhD guide Nirdesh Sharma. Given that the current landslide predictions require a large amount of annotated landslide remote sensing satellite data which is laborious and time-consuming to prepare, the new tool, according to Joshi, is ""an open-source app available on Google Earth that speeds up all the landslide studies and landslide forecasting models, producing high-quality data within a minute with minimal human effort"". Aaditeshwar Seth of the School of IT led the CoRE stack initiative. Seth said, ""CoRE stack is a solution to provide rural communities with tools that can help them understand the socio-ecological aspects of their landscapes, make informed decisions, facilitate access to public and private funding and guide them on creating sustainable ecosystems.""

Delhi government announces odd-even curbs after Diwali,The Times of India (TOI),11-07-2023,INDIA,"NEW DELHI: Delhi will again implement the odd-even traffic restriction plan — the fourth overall and the first since 2019 — from November 13 to 20 as a measure to check air pollution after Diwali, the city government announced on Monday even as the capital continued to choke on ‘severe’ air quality for the fifth straight day.While the government would share details of the plan in the next two-three days, officials said electric and CNG-run cars and two-wheelers are likely to remain exempted from the restrictions. The first meeting to work out the modalities in the presence of transport department officials and Delhi traffic police will likely take place on Tuesday.To safeguard the health of schoolchildren, the government also decided to suspend physical classes in all schools, except for students of classes X and XII preparing for board exams. A decision on making 50% of staff in government and private offices to work from home will be taken after Diwali.The odd-even rule restricts the number of private cars on roads based on their number plates. Vehicles with even last digit (including zero) are allowed to run on even dates and odd-numbered cars can ply on odd dates. 
These curbs have been imposed in the capital three times in the past after being introduced in 2016.The decision on implementing odd-even traffic curbs was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday to discuss the alarming air quality in the capital.A 2018 joint study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) says vehicular emissions contribute 28% to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels and 24% to PM10 during winters.Addressing a press conference after the meeting, environment minister Rai said: “The odd-even scheme will come into effect in Delhi after Diwali, running from November 13 to November 20.”He added that the government will take a decision to extend the traffic restrictions beyond November 20 after assessing the situation at that time.In the previous editions, the government had exempted scooters and motorcycles, vehicles with CNG-stickers, women-only cars with children up to the age of 12 years and vehicles occupied by physically disabled persons.In December 2017, the odd-even rule had to be called off at the last moment after the National Green Tribunal refused to exempt two-wheelers from the scheme.Rai said that directives had been issued to implement stringent restrictions mandated under stage IV, the final of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR to control air pollution.The restrictions under GRAP-IV, including a ban on all kinds of construction work and the entry of polluting trucks into the capital, kicked in on Sunday after air quality in the capital dropped to “severe plus” (AQI above 450) levels.The minister said that air pollution may improve over the next few days due to an expected increase in wind speed. He, however, cautioned that the air quality may deteriorate again due to factors such as firecracker burning during Diwali. Rai said directions had been issued to the police to keep their teams on alert, as Diwali was just a few days away. He also urged the BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to impose a ban on fireworks in their states to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.Rai added that the Delhi government had taken several long-term measures – introduction of electric buses, implementation of EV policy for private vehicles, increasing green cover and imposing ban on bursting crackers – to mitigate pollution, which had borne fruit.

Reliance Industries joins hand with DBS Bank India to fuel green revolution with Compressed Biogas project,The Times of India (TOI),12/13/2023,INDIA BUSINESS,"Reliance Industries and DBS Bank India have collaborated to introduce a financing initiative aimed at supporting the establishment of compressed biogas (CBG) plants. The initiative aims to foster the development of an ecosystem where vendor partners can aggregate agricultural residue as raw material for Reliance's CBG production plants throughout India.In a press release, the company highlighted the significant volume of agricultural residue in India, often disposed of through burning due to a lack of processing infrastructure and logistical support. The existing agricultural residue supply chain has been disorganized, with farmers and aggregators lacking proper incentives and financial support.Reliance Industries views this initiative as a crucial element in its net-zero roadmap. 
The company intends to invest nationwide to produce CBG as an eco-friendly alternative to imported compressed natural gas (CNG) and other fossil fuels, positioning India as a notable bio-fuel source. While CBG technology has advanced, commercialization necessitates new infrastructure and engagement with the value chain, involving farmers across various states, the company release said.Harindra K Tripathi, head of Bio-energy Business at Reliance Industries, emphasized the significance of CBG plants in utilizing organic waste, a major contributor to air pollution. ""Beyond mitigating carbon emissions, the CBG plants will also contribute to the production of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM), enhancing soil fertility and reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers over time,"" Tripathi said.Rajat Verma, managing director and head of Institutional Banking at DBS Bank India, underscored the importance of India's green energy sector in the country's net-zero strategy. He commended Reliance Industries' bold initiative and emphasized the pivotal role of transition financing in enabling businesses to adopt and scale innovative technologies for decarbonization. Over the next five years, Reliance plans to establish approximately 100 CBG plants, consuming over 5.5 million tonnes per annum of agricultural residue and organic waste. This initiative is projected to result in a yearly reduction of nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

"Bhopal air turns toxic again, AQI plunges to ‘poor mark’",The Times of India (TOI),12-06-2023,BHOPAL,"Bhopal: City’s air quality deteriorated again as soon as the showers stopped.
Last week, showers did wonders; the air quality came down from very poor to satisfactory and moderate levels with AQI below 100 mark on November 27 and 28. The air pollution was constantly increasing over the past four days, and it doubled and crossed the 200 mark on Monday. 
During this time of year winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state due to which the air quality index of MP cities could go up to 20 per cent, said meteorological department officials of the Bhopal circle said. 
Secondly, the air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid troposphere, it comes to the low troposphere, which increases pollution levels, the officials added. 
Experts point out that local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, make the situation worse. 
The air pollution comes down during rains as dust gets heavy and does not fly in the air. 
Since Diwali, the air quality of Bhopal was not fit to breathe. However, showers last week brought it to satisfactory levels, but it went up again after the rain stopped in the city. 
Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health and causes severe lung diseases. 
PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions.

PM2.5 load uneven: Fewer ‘good’ days in 2023 than last four years,The Times of India (TOI),01-10-2024,FARIDABAD,"GURGAON: The city’s PM2.5 levels met the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) of 60 micrograms per cubic metre on just 115 days in 2023, according to Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).PM2.5 levels were in the ‘good’ category (up to 30 g/m3) on nine days in 2023. In contrast, 2022 reported 40 such days. In 2021, PM2.5 levels were ‘good’ for 21 days; in 2020, for 49 days; and in 2019, for 31 days.According to CREA data, the city’s PM2.5 levels met NAAQS norms on 109 days in 2022. The figure stood at 159 days in 2021, 173 days in 2020 and 122 days in 2019 (see graphic).The pollutant levels were ‘satisfactory’ (30-60 g/m3) for 106 days in 2023, up from 69 days in 2022 but a dip from 2021 (138 days). There were seven ‘severe’ pollution days (when PM2.5 levels were above 250 g/m3) last year — against just two in 2022 and five in 2021.The average PM2.5 concentration in 2023 was 90 g/m3, the same as the year before. Both were much higher than the NAAQS, which is 40 g/m3. The annual PM2.5 concentration was 92 g/m3 in 2021, 82 g/m3 in 2020 and 94 g/m3in 2019.PM2.5 refers to air particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter, which is approximately 1/30th the width of a strand of human hair. 
It consists of fine, toxic particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and cause heart disease, stroke and other respiratory diseases. PM2.5 data is a parameter widely used for assessing the impacts of air pollution on health.“While there has been a notable decline in the frequency of ‘poor’ air quality days in Gurgaon, the number of days with ‘good’ air has decreased too. This suggests that while there has been some improvement in managing peak pollution episodes, the same persistent sources of pollution continue to compromise the city’s air quality for a majority of the year,” said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at CREA.He added, “Overall pollution levels have not seen a decrease since 2020. This implies a rise in the number of vehicles and heightened contributions from regional sources such as industries, power plants and construction activities, among others. The city requires a comprehensive action plan with targeted reductions in emission loads within the broader airshed.”According to experts, the analysis reflects that the gradual long-term improvement in annual PM2.5 levels since 2018 came to a halt in the last two years. “With a dip in stubble burning, an increase in rainfall between March to June, the annual pollutant levels should have improved. Instead, adverse meteorological conditions, specifically lower wind speeds, exacerbated the situation due to persistently high local pollution. The city had been experiencing a consistent decline in its annual PM2.5 levels since 2018. There was a drastic drop in 2020 due to lockdowns imposed during the pandemic. It increased slightly in 2021, but in the last two years, there has been no improvement,” said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Centre for Science and Environment.As many as 11 Haryana cities are in the top 50 most polluted cities around the world, according to the 2021 World Air Quality Report. These include Hisar (with the average PM2.5 that year at 89 g/m3), Faridabad (88.9 g/m3), Rohtak (86.9 g/m3), Jind (84.1 g/m3), Gurgaon (92 g/m3), Dharuhera (75.8 g/m3), Charkhi Dadri (73.9 g/m3), Yamunanagar (73.3 g/m3), Sonipat (68.7 g/m3), Kurukshetra (68.1 g/m3) and Ambala (65.3 g/m3).

TVS tollgate flyover in Trichy to get LED rope lights,The Times of India (TOI),03-11-2024,TRICHY,"Trichy: As part of beautifying the major entry points of Trichy city, the City Corporation has allocated `12.7 lakh to illuminate and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the TVS tollgate flyover. Situated at the intersection of the Chennai-Trichy-Madurai NH and Trichy-Pudukottai NH, the flyover will receive LED rope lights in two different capacities to illuminate the space below, which has been redeveloped as a green area.
Located in ward 47 in zone II, the TVS tollgate flyover and the roads passing through the locality are frequently accessed by VVIPs visiting Trichy airport and the circuit house near the zonal corporation office. Due to the vacant space below the flyover being misused for open urination, the area has been fenced to prevent the floating population waiting at bus stops from polluting the space.
The civic body plans to install 6-watt LED rope lights below the flyover to decorate the green space at night. Modern lights will be installed on a trial basis at 16 locations. Additionally, two new water fountains have been developed in the space below the flyover and adorned with decorative plants. Officials said that the water fountains were installed based on the suggestions of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to reduce air pollution caused by vehicle emissions at major road intersections.
Similarly, an additional Rs 8.4 lakh has been allocated for extra lights on the center median connecting the TVS tollgate with the Head Post Office (HPO) traffic signal in Cantonment. Approximately 110 LED lights are planned to be installed.
